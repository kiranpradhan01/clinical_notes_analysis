      Extensive lymphadenopathy involving mediastinum, hila, abdomen and
      retroperitoneum.  Massive soft tissue masses within the mediastinum, with
      tracheal deviation and compression, although airways remain patent to the
      subsegmental bronchi.  Pericardial effusion.

     INDICATION:  HIV position with left flank pain bilateral upper quadrant pain
     and mass on chest x-ray.
     
     COMPARISONS:  None
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous helically acquired axial images were obtained through
     the abdomen prior to and following the administration of 100 cc of intravenous
     Optiray.  Post-contrast imaging was obtained from the lung apices to the pubic
     symphysis.
     
     CONTRAST:  Oral and intravenous non-ionic contrast were administered due to
     the rapid rate of bolus injection required for this examination.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There is extensive mediastinal
     lymphadenopathy, with multiple enlarged lymph nodes in anterior, middle, and
     posterior mediastinum.  The largest conglomerate mass measures 11.8 x 8.7 cm.
     A pretracheal node measures 4.3 x 2.6 cm.  A prevascular node measures 3.5 x
     2.6 cm.  Innumerable additional anterior mediastinal, prevascular,
     pretracheal, and subcarinal nodes are present.  There is evidence of
     displacement and deformation of the trachea, however the airways remain patent
     to the level of the subsegmental bronchi at the time of this examination.
     There is no definite evidence of vascular compression.  A small pericardial
     effusion is seen.  A small left hilar node measures 1.7 x 1.3 cm.  A pleural
     based mass is present within the left hemithorax medially (series 3A, image
     50) measuring 5.5 x 3.0 cm.  The lung fields appear unremarkable, without
     evidence of intraparenchymal nodules or masses.  There are dependent changes
     posteriorly and bilaterally.  There is no evidence of pathologic enlargement
     of axillary nodes.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The liver,
     gallbladder, spleen, and adrenal glands appear unremarkable.  Adjacent to the
     tail of the pancreas and the splenic hilum is a soft tissue mass with ill-
     defined borders measuring 7.4 x 6.2 cm.  There is no fat plane separating this
     mass from the splenic hilum or the tail of the pancreas.  There are prominent
                                                                 (Over)

     calcifications of the splenic artery.  The splenic vein appears patent.  The
     large and small bowel loops are normal in caliber and there is no abnormal
     bowel wall thickening, allowing for poor contrast opacification of small
     bowel.  The kidneys are atrophic bilaterally, with multiple calcifications and
     cysts within the renal parenchyma.  The larger cyst on the left measures 1.5
     cm in diameter.  The larger cyst on the right measures 9 mm in diameter. There
     are prominent enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes, the largest of which
     measures 1.6 x 1.8 cm (series 3B, image 96) in a para-aortic region. There is
     no free fluid and no free air within the abdomen.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The bladder, distal ureters,
     prostate, and rectum appear unremarkable.  There is trace free fluid within
     the pelvis.  There is no definite pathologic appearing pelvic or inguinal
     lymphadenopathy.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  Within the L4 vertebral body, there is an area of bony
     sclerosis surrounding a hypodensity adjacent to an intervertebral disk space.
     There is no evidence of cortical destruction.  These findings most likely
     represent degenerative change with sclerosis surrounding a Schmorl's node.
     Additional low density lesions are seen within multiple vertebral bodies, also
     adjacent to intervertebral disk spaces and consistent with degenerative
     change.  No definite suspicious lytic or sclerotic bony lesions are
     identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1)  Extensive lymphadenopathy within the mediastinum,
     retroperitoneum, and splenic hilum is most consistent with lymphoma.
     2)  Deformation and deviation of the trachea due to compression from
     surrounding soft tissue masses, without airway obstruction at the time of this
     examination.
     3)  Small pericardial effusion.
     4)  Atrophic kidneys bilaterally
     5)  No evidence of bowel obstruction or perforation
     6)  Probable degenerative changes within the thoracic and lumbo-sacral spines,
     although attention to the L4 vertebral body is recommended on follow up.
     
     These results were discussed with clinical provider at the time of
     interpretation.

                                     FINAL REPORT *ABNORMAL!
     (Cont)
     calcifications of the splenic artery.  The splenic vein appears patent.  The
     large and small bowel loops are normal in caliber and there is no abnormal
     bowel wall thickening, allowing for poor contrast opacification of small
     bowel.  The kidneys are atrophic bilaterally, with multiple calcifications and
     cysts within the renal parenchyma.  The larger cyst on the left measures 1.5
     cm in diameter.  The larger cyst on the right measures 9 mm in diameter. There
     are prominent enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes, the largest of which
     measures 1.6 x 1.8 cm (series 3B, image 96) in a para-aortic region. There is
     no free fluid and no free air within the abdomen.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The bladder, distal ureters,
     prostate, and rectum appear unremarkable.  There is trace free fluid within
     the pelvis.  There is no definite pathologic appearing pelvic or inguinal
     lymphadenopathy.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  Within the L4 vertebral body, there is an area of bony
     sclerosis surrounding a hypodensity adjacent to an intervertebral disk space.
     There is no evidence of cortical destruction.  These findings most likely
     represent degenerative change with sclerosis surrounding a Schmorl's node.
     Additional low density lesions are seen within multiple vertebral bodies, also
     adjacent to intervertebral disk spaces and consistent with degenerative
     change.  No definite suspicious lytic or sclerotic bony lesions are
     identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1)  Extensive lymphadenopathy within the mediastinum,
     retroperitoneum, and splenic hilum is most consistent with lymphoma.
     2)  Deformation and deviation of the trachea due to compression from
     surrounding soft tissue masses, without airway obstruction at the time of this
     examination.
     3)  Small pericardial effusion.
     4)  Atrophic kidneys bilaterally
     5)  No evidence of bowel obstruction or perforation
     6)  Probable degenerative changes within the thoracic and lumbo-sacral spines,
     although attention to the L4 vertebral body is recommended on follow up.
     
     These results were discussed with clinical provider at the time of
     interpretation.

     INDICATION:  History of mediastinal mass with shortness of breath and
     tachycardia.  Evaluate for pulmonary embolus.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically-acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     lung apices to the diaphragms before and after the administration of IV
     contrast.  Non-ionic contrast was used secondary to rapid bolus requirement
     needed per protocol.  A total of 180 cc of IV contrast was administered as the
     study had to be repeated given the suboptimal bolus during the first scan.
      Multiplanar reconstructions were obtained.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:  Again seen is extensive
     mediastinal lymphadenopathy involving the anterior, middle, and posterior
     mediastinum, all of which appear relatively stable in size since the prior
     study. The largest conglomerate mass now measures 12.0 x 8.7 cm, previously
     11.8 x 8.7 cm. The largest pretracheal node measures 4.1 x 2.6 cm, previously
     4.3 x 2.6 cm. A prevascular node now measures 4.1 x 3.1 cm, previously 3.5 x
     2.6 cm. Again seen are innumerable prevascular, pretracheal, hilar, and
     subcarinal lymph nodes. The trachea again appears displaced and posteriorly
     compressed, which is not significantly changed from the prior study.  The
     esophagus is also displaced by the mediastinal mass. There is narrowing of the
     left brachiocephalic vein and marked compression of the superior vena cava,
     findings which appear relatively stable from the prior study.  A small left
     pericardial effusion is again identified, unchanged from the prior study.
     Additionally seen is a left paraspinal mass which may have increased slightly
     in size measuring 5.7 x 3.3 cm, previously 5.5 x 3.0 cm. There is no
     significant axillary lymphadenopathy.
     
     The pulmonary arterial vasculature is suboptimally visualized.  No gross
     pulmonary embolus is identified.
     
     Lung field images reveal no pulmonary nodules or areas of parenchymal
     consolidation.  The segmental bronchi are patent without evidence of
     significant compression.  Within the visualized portion of the upper abdomen,
                                                                 (Over)

     INDICATION:  History of mediastinal mass with shortness of breath and
     tachycardia.  Evaluate for pulmonary embolus.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically-acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     lung apices to the diaphragms before and after the administration of IV
     contrast.  Non-ionic contrast was used secondary to rapid bolus requirement
     needed per protocol.  A total of 180 cc of IV contrast was administered as the
     study had to be repeated given the suboptimal bolus during the first scan.
      Multiplanar reconstructions were obtained.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:  Again seen is extensive
     mediastinal lymphadenopathy involving the anterior, middle, and posterior
     mediastinum, all of which appear relatively stable in size since the prior
     study. The largest conglomerate mass now measures 12.0 x 8.7 cm, previously
     11.8 x 8.7 cm. The largest pretracheal node measures 4.1 x 2.6 cm, previously
     4.3 x 2.6 cm. A prevascular node now measures 4.1 x 3.1 cm, previously 3.5 x
     2.6 cm. Again seen are innumerable prevascular, pretracheal, hilar, and
     subcarinal lymph nodes. The trachea again appears displaced and posteriorly
     compressed, which is not significantly changed from the prior study.  The
     esophagus is also displaced by the mediastinal mass. There is narrowing of the
     left brachiocephalic vein and marked compression of the superior vena cava,
     findings which appear relatively stable from the prior study.  A small left
     pericardial effusion is again identified, unchanged from the prior study.
     Additionally seen is a left paraspinal mass which may have increased slightly
     in size measuring 5.7 x 3.3 cm, previously 5.5 x 3.0 cm. There is no
     significant axillary lymphadenopathy.
     
     The pulmonary arterial vasculature is suboptimally visualized.  No gross
     pulmonary embolus is identified.
     
     Lung field images reveal no pulmonary nodules or areas of parenchymal
     consolidation.  The segmental bronchi are patent without evidence of
     significant compression.  Within the visualized portion of the upper abdomen,
                                                                 (Over)

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Upper GI bleed.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 51 year-old male with
a history of HIV positive, hypertension, end stage renal
disease recently diagnosed high grade B cell lymphoma who
presents with abdominal pain times one day.  The pain began
the day prior to admission in the evening was, mid epigastric
described as spasm.  The patient has drank some ETOH
yesterday.  He denies fevers or chills, hematemesis, bright
red blood per rectum, melena, though he states he has a
history of the latter two years ago.  He had no recent
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs use and no history of
peptic ulcer disease.  He had a normal colonoscopy one year
ago per report.  In the Emergency Department he vomited what
appeared to be coffee grounds and was gastroccult positive
and nasogastric lavage was clearing after 1.5 liters of
fluid.  A rectal showed heme negative stool.  Hematocrit on
[**2-15**] was 31.6 and now noted to be 28.1, however, the patient
was hemodynamically stable.  Recently he was on Prednisone
for CHOP therapy and this was stopped on [**2-15**].  He had not
been on a PPI.  He was initially admitted to the MICU for
observation and was transferred to the floor after two units
of packed red blood cell transfusion and hematocrit
stabilization.  He also received DDAVP per renal for
dysfunctional/low platelets.  In the MICU an
esophagogastroduodenoscopy was attempted, but unable to be
successfully performed as the patient was very agitated and
uncooperative despite sedation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  HIV, CD4 330 and viral load 60,000 in [**3373-7-2**].  No
history of opportunistic infections.
2.  End stage renal disease on hemodialysis Monday, Wednesday
and Friday.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  High grade B cell lymphoma diagnosed [**1-5**] with
compression of trachea/esophagus by mediastinal lymph[**MD Number 285**]
on CT, status post CHOP initiated [**3374-2-5**], Neulasta and
Prednisone 100 mg po q.d. times ten days, which was stopped
on [**2-15**].

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Allopurinol 100 mg po q.o.d.
2.  Efavirenz 600 mg po q.d.
3.  Lopinavir/Ritonavir four tablets po b.i.d.
4.  Bactrim SS one tablet po q.d.
5.  Zofran 2 to 4 mg intravenously q 6 hours prn on transfer
from MICU.
6.  Nephrocaps one tablet po q.d.
7.  Tenofovir 300 mg po q week.
8.  Sevelamer 4 grams po t.i.d.
9.  Nifedipine 120 mg po q.d.
10.  Lopressor 100 mg po b.i.d.
11.  Losartan 100 mg po q.d.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Father with diabetes and coronary artery
disease.  Two siblings with lymphoma.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Tobacco one pack per day times many years.
Smokes on weekends.  ETOH on weekends.  Former IVDU and
cocaine.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 98.7.  Pulse
100.  Blood pressure 124/71.  Respirations 24.  Oxygen
saturation 95% on room air.  General, the patient is
somnolent after large doses of morphine in the Emergency
Department, but arousable.  HEENT pupils are equal, round and
reactive to light.  Extraocular movements intact.  Mucous
membranes are moist.  Neck supple.  No JVD.  Lungs clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular regular rate,
normal S1 and S2.  Prominent point of maximal impulse
slightly left shifted.  Tachycardic.  Abdomen normoactive
bowel sounds, soft, nondistended.  Tender epigastric area to
palpation, but no rebound or guarding.  Extremities no
clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  2+ pedal pulses.  Neurological
alert and oriented times three.  Rectal heme negative stool.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 9.0
with 87% neutrophils, 7.4% lymphocytes.  Hematocrit 28.1,
baseline mid 30s.  Platelets 82, baseline 200, but decreased
since [**2-15**].  Chemistries are remarkable for a sodium of 140,
potassium 4.1, chloride 93, bicarb 33, BUN 50, creatinine 7.8
with a baseline 5 to 7, glucose 136, amylase 122, lipase 27,
ALT 15, AST 39, T bilirubin 0.3, alkaline phosphatase 110,
INR 1.3, calcium 10.9, magnesium 2.0, phos 5.5, albumin 3.4.
Chest x-ray showed widened mediastinum, paraspinal mass,
improvement of left base atelectasis with new interstitial
opacity at bilateral bases, questionable nodular infection
versus blood aspiration.  KUB showed no free air or
obstruction.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Epigastric pain/GI bleed:  The
patient's hematocrit remained stable the entire admission
status post 2 units of packed red blood cell transfusion.
However, he did not have an appropriate bump in his
hematocrit, which increased from 28.1 to 29 and then to 31 by
the next day.  This was thought to be possibly secondary to
his malignancy, but not to ongoing blood loss as he did not
have any further bowel movements during his admission
nor hematemesis.  Gastrointestinal was consulted and
esophagogastroduodenoscopy was unable to be performed
secondary to patient compliance/tolerance.  If the patient
were to bleed again he would likely need
esophagogastroduodenoscopy under general anesthesia.  Per
Gastrointestinal given the patient's stabilization will
advance his diet as tolerated and once hematocrit is stable
for another 24 hours it is likely to be discontinued.  The
etiology of epigastric pain unclear.  The patient may have
ulcer, gastritis, candidiasis secondary to immunocompromise
or bowel obstruction secondary to tumor burden.  He will be
discharged on Protonix q.d. only and GI is still unclear as
to whether the patient truly had upper gastrointestinal bleed
as gastroccult can be positive with very small amounts of
blood from elsewhere as well.  He had an H-pylori serology
sent, which is pending at this time.

2.  Anemia:  Hematocrit remained stable after checking b.i.d.
He has had a slow trend downward from baseline in mid 30s
since [**1-5**] possibly secondary to malignancy/chemotherapy.

3.  Thrombocytopenia:  Though decreased platelets, they were
stable during his admission and were thought to be secondary
to chemotherapy as sudden decline after starting CHOP.  The
patient was given DDAVP times one for possibly dysfunctional
platelets in the setting of end stage renal disease per
renal.

4.  Lymphoma:  Hematology/Oncology followed the patient
during admission and had no acute suggestions.  He continued
on Allopurinol for decreasing likelihood of tumor lysis
syndrome.

5.  End stage renal disease:  Continued hemodialysis Monday,
Wednesday and Friday.

6.  Hypertension:  As blood pressure stabilized and the
patient became more hypertensive after transfusion and taking
po his home blood pressure medications of Lopressor, Cozaar
and Nifedipine were restarted.

7.  HIV:  Continued home medications.

8.  Substance abuse:  The patient on CIWA scale for ETOH use
by history.

9.  Prophylaxis:  B.i.d. PPI changed to q.d. PPI per GI,
subcutaneous heparin.

10.  Throat discomfort:  Ordered Nystatin swish and
swallow/KBL/Cepacol lozenges for some throat pain likely
secondary to esophagogastroduodenoscopy the prior day.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Upper GI bleed/gastritis.
2.  Anemia.
3.  Thrombocytopenia.
4.  HIV disease.
5.  B cell lymphoma.
6.  Hypertension.
7.  End stage renal disease.
8.  Substance abuse.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  As per admission medications with the
addition of:
1.  Pantoprazole 40 mg po q.d.
2.  Nystatin swish and swallow prn.
3.  Cepacol lozenges prn.

FOLLOW UP PLANS:  The patient will follow up with his primary
care physician in the next one to two weeks.

Any further hospital course will be dictated as an addendum
as needed.

     INDICATION: NG tube placement.
     
     COMPARISON: [**3374-2-2**].
     
     AP SINGLE VIEW OF THE CHEST: The NG tube extends below the limits of the
     radiograph in the stomach. However, the abdominal radiograph performed at the
     same time shows that the tube may be in the duodenum and I recommend pulling
     the tube back approximately 10 cm.
     
     Again noted is the widening of the mediastinum and the paraspinal mass. There
     appears to be interval improvement at the left base atelectasis. There appears
     to be a new interstitial opacity in the bilateral bases which is somewhat
     nodular of unknown clinical significance and could represent infectious
     process. Alternatively, it could represent aspiration of blood contents.

     PA AND LATERAL CHEST: Comparison is made to the study from [**3374-2-18**] chest x-ray
     as well as earlier chest x-ray of [**3370-7-10**].
     
     There is widening of the mediastinum particularly in the mediastinum above the
     level of the aortic knob, but also extending into the right paratracheal
     region to the level of the tracheal bronchial angle.  This is markedly
     improved compared to the previous study, even allowing for differences in
     technique.  The hilar contours and cardiac silhouette are normal.  The lungs
     demonstrate no focal areas of consolidation.  There are minor areas of linear
     opacity at the bases, and note is made of interval development of small
     bilateral pleural effusions.  Skeletal structures reveal diffuse
     demineralization. Overall, the lung volumes appear increased.
     
     IMPRESSION: Interval decrease in mediastinal widening likely related to
     improving lymphadenopathy from known history of lymphoma.
     
     Minimal bibasilar linear opacities most likely due to discoid atelectasis. No
     definite pneumonia.
     
     Small bilateral pleural effusions, new in the interval.
