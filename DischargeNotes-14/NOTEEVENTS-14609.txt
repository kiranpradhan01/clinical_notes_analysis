ERCP Impression:
1. Evidence of a previous sphincterotomy
2. A metal stent was noted within the bile duct
3. Succesful cannulation with a balloon catheter
4. Multiple irregular filling defects were noted along the 
entire stent suggestive of sludge and possible tumor invasion.
5. The stent was swept using a balloon. Copious amount of sludge 
and pus was succesfully extracted.

CT Abdomen/Pelvis Impression:
1. Marked progression of diffuse metastatic disease throughout 
the liver, in the retroperitoneum, encasing the left gastric 
artery, and within the visualized portions of the lingula and 
mediastinum/hilum. Peritoneal carcinomatosis.

2. More confluent opacity at the right lung base likely 
represents a predominantly consolidation/atelectasis, with small 
bilateral pleural effusions.

3. Biliary stent is seen extending from the right bile duct to 
the common bile duct, but is predominantly filled with soft 
tissue density material, likely representing tumor ingrowth from 
the large masses described above.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] was initially admitted to the Surgical ICU the early 
morning of [**2711-12-15**] and underwent fluid and electrolyte 
resuscitation and correction of his coagulation parameters.  A 
regimen of Vancomycin and Zosyn was initiated.  Later on the 
29th, he underwent an ERCP, with findings noted in the previous 
section.
  After his ERCP, he was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 455**] 10.  He showed no 
signs or symptoms of pancreatitis.  On [**12-16**], blood cultures 
drawn from the emergency room grew gram positive rods, which 
later proved to be Psudomonas aeruginosa.  Due to an increase in 
his bilirubin from 26.3 prior to ERCP to 35.4 afterwards, a CT 
scan was performed.  The results are in the previous section.
  On [**2711-12-18**], Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] received a PICC line at the bedside for 
his need for IV antibiotics.  On [**2711-12-19**], this was repositioned 
by interventional radiology.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1695**] spent a good deal of 
time with Mr. and Mrs. [**Known patient lastname **] in the evening discussing his 
prognosis, considering his CT and laboratory findings.  On 
[**2711-12-20**], physical therapy evaluated Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] and found him with 
more than enough strength to be independent.  The therapist was 
of the opinion that Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] would do well at home.  On [**2711-12-21**], 
hospital day 7, Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] was seen by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4287**], of Palliative 
Care to discuss hospice.
  Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] was then discharged to his home on [**2711-12-22**] with VNA 
care for his IV antibiotics.  He will have a total course of 14 
days of Zosyn.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      64 year old man with bilirubin of 35 s/p ERCP                                   
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Please evaluate liver/biliary system with IV/PO contrast                        
     No contraindications for IV contrast
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Bilirubin 35 status post ERCP. History of metastatic colon
     cancer.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were performed
     before and after the IV administration of 120 cc of Optiray nonionic contrast.
     Comparison is made to examination of [**2711-4-27**].
     
     Additional multiplanar reformatted images were also reviewed at the time of
     interpretation.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST:  Evaluation of the lung bases
     demonstrate multiple pulmonary masses, which have grown significantly in size
     since the prior examination.  One mass is seen at the posterolateral aspect of
     the lingula, measuring approximately 2.2 x 3.5 cm in greatest axial
     dimensions, abuts the pleural surface, and was approximately 8 mm in diameter
     on the prior examination.  Multiple other smaller pulmonary nodules are also
     seen within the visualized portion of the lingula, also consistent with
     metastases. Minimal left-sided basilar atelectasis and small left pleural
     effusion is present.  Right-sided basilar atelectasis/consolidation is seen at
     the lower lobes, also with a small right-sided pleural effusion.  Note is made
     of a large subcarinal lymph node measuring approximately 2.7 x 7.0 cm, and
     significant right hilar adenopathy measuring approximately 3.5 cm in diameter.
     No evidence of thrombus is seen within the visualized portions of the
     pulmonary vasculature. Prominent coronary artery calcifications are present.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST:  Patient is s/p left hepatectomy.
     Metallic biliary stent is seen within the right bile ducts extending down
     through the hepatic duct and common bile ducts, but appears filled with soft
     tissue density material, presumably tumor invasion. Innumerable hypoenhancing
     lesions are seen throughout the liver, representing a marked progression since
     the prior examination. A dominant 7.1 x 5.6 cm hypodense mass at the caudate
     lobe and segment VIII of the liver and encasing the IVC is present, and
     extending without discernable fat plane into 5.1 x 6.4 cm extrahepatic nodal
     mass which encases the left gastric artery, predominantly superior to the
     celiac artery.  A second portal venous nodal mass is seen, measuring
     approximately 3.5 x 4.0 cm in maximal transverse dimensions, just posterior to
     the pancreatic head and common bile duct. Multiple retroperitoneal lymph nodes
     are also seen in the aortocaval space, retrocaval space, and paraaortic space.
     
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT
     (Cont)
     Multiple enhancing nodes are also seen within the large fat-containing ventral
     hernia, with nodularity of the omentum consistent with peritoneal
     carcinomatosis.  A 19 x 25 mm enhancing nodal mass seen along the anterior
     aspect of the pancreatic tail is also consistent with metastatic disease.
     
     Minimal abdominal free fluid is present.  There is no evidence of portal vein
     thrombosis.  The right hepatic vein is also patent.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS AFTER IV CONTRAST:  The large bowel, bladder, and distal
     ureters are unremarkable, with a Foley catheter in place.  Surgical sutures
     seen in the region of the sigmoid colon is consistent with prior resection.
     There is no pelvic lymphadenopathy.  A small amount of pelvic free fluid is
     present.
     
     Examination of osseous structures do not show lytic or sclerotic lesions
     suspicious for malignancy.
     
     Multiplanar reformatted images support the findings above.  Degenerative
     changes of the lower lumbar spine are also seen.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Marked progression of diffuse metastatic disease throughout the liver, in
     the retroperitoneum, encasing the left gastric artery, and within the
     visualized portions of the lingula and mediastinum/hilum. Peritoneal
     carcinomatosis.
     
     2.  More confluent opacity at the right lung base likely represents a
     predominantly consolidation/atelectasis, with small bilateral pleural
     effusions.
     
     3.  Biliary stent is seen extending from the right bile duct to the common
     bile duct, but is predominantly filled with soft tissue density material,
     likely representing tumor ingrowth from the large masses described above.

     HISTORY:  PICC reposition.
     
     Fluoroscopy reveals a PICC line at the junction of the right IJ and subclavian
     veins.  The current catheter was therefore advanced with its tip in the distal
     SVC.  This was then secured in place.
