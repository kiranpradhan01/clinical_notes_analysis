Admission Date:  [**2640-9-14**]     Discharge Date:  [**2640-9-25**]

Date of Birth:   [**2552-12-25**]     Sex:  F

Service:  CMED

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Congestive heart failure:  The patient was continued on
nesiritide drip until the day of discharge.  In addition, she
was treated with daily IV Lasix and started on five days of
Diamox therapy.  She continued to have negative fluid balance
daily and was comfortable on low flow oxygen on the day of
discharge with oxygen saturations in the mid 90s.  She should
continue to have her daily Lasix, and she should complete
four more days of Diamox therapy.  Please check her weights
daily and follow her potassium as Lasix may cause
hypokalemia.  Please continue her daily digoxin at 0.125 and
check her digoxin level in one week.

2. Fall:  The patient fell on [**9-23**], while trying to
wipe herself on the commode.  She hit her head on the floor
and had a 3 cm in diameter superficial hematoma on her left
parietal scalp.  She had a nonfocal neurological examination.
Head CT scan, C spine films, and hips and pelvis x-rays
showed no acute trauma.  The patient is weak after her
extended hospital stay, and will need Physical Therapy in
rehab.  She continues to have a nonfocal examination and is
cleared for discharge.

3. Bilateral pleural effusions:  The patient has had chronic
bilateral pleural effusions that were being treated with
aggressive diuresis.  The right effusion has improved during
her hospital, however, the left side has had an interval
increase in size.  The patient refused an inpatient
thoracentesis despite having all of the benefits explained to
her.  She should be asked again as an outpatient and should
call the Interventional Pulmonary Department at [**Hospital1 392**] to schedule an outpatient
thoracentesis if she changes her mind.

4. Swallowing:  The patient passed her swallowing study, but
should have her medications crushed in apple sauce as she
refuses to take them if they are not prepared in that way.

5. Depression:  The patient was seen by Psychiatry during
this admission as she was refusing po medications.  She was
seen and it was determined that she was not clinically
depressed at this time.  She responds well to attention and
should be engaged in conversation and group activities, and
rehab as much as possible.

6. Atrial fibrillation:  She should continue to take her
daily Coumadin and have her INR checked every 2-3 days
initially.  Her goal INR is 2.0-3.0.  She should continue to
take 400 mg po of amiodarone daily for the next four weeks.
At that time, her dose should be adjusted to 200 mg daily.
Please check LFTs every 2-3 months.

7. Code status:  The patient has clearly expressed her wishes
to be DNR/DNI.  The family members were present, were in
agreement.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Lipitor 10 mg po daily.
2. Carvedilol 6.25 mg bid.
3. Captopril 6.25 mg tid.
4. Lasix 20 mg IV once daily.
5. Acetazolamide 250 mg one tablet po q day.
