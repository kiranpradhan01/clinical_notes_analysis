Service: MEDICINE
 
Allergies: 
Sulfa (Sulfonamides)
 
Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 606**] 
Chief Complaint:
PNA, rapid A fib, SDH 
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

 
History of Present Illness:
79 yo man with DM, A fib (not on coumadin), who presented to 
[**Hospital1 **] around 9 pm c/o 1 day h/o fever (Tm104) and cough. 
Earlier that morning he syncopized while getting up from a chair 
and had head trauma. He proceeded to become more lethargic 
throughout the day after the fall. At [**Hospital1 **] he was diagnosed 
with RML PNA and diffuse sinusitis (given Ceftriaxone, 
Zithromax, 1L IVF), A fib with RVR at [**Street Address 11342**] 
depressions, and an acute 1.3 cm R tentorial subdural hematoma. 
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for further evaluation. Seen by 
neurosurg who felt that given location of hematoma and normal 
neuro exam, treatment would be conservative with serial neuro 
exams and repeat head CT later today.  
.  
Patient currently denies chest pain, palpitations, 
lightheadedness, or any pain. He does have some ""rattling"" in 
his chest but denies SOB.  

 
Past Medical History:
- A fib  
- DM 2  
- HTN  
- h/o PNA with resultant pulm scarring  

 
Social History:
visiting from upstate [**State 3255**] 
 
Physical Exam:
Tm 99.0, HR 98, BP 96/50, RR 13, 85% on 3L  
GEN - NAD, A&Ox3  
HEENT - PERRL, EOMI, OP clear, mucosa dry  
LUNGS - rales diffusely with egophany R base and R side, 
expiratory wheezes in upper zones  
HEART - irreg irreg, no murmurs appreciated  
ABD - soft, NT/ND, NABS, no hsm  
EXT - no edema, 2+ pedal pulses

#########################################################
CXR:  Parenchymal infiltrate in right-sided mid lung field 
probably representing acute infection, follow up is recommended 
as there exist no previous chest examinations in our records for 
comparison.
#########################################################
CT HEAD:  There is a small amount of blood tracking primarily 
along the right falx and tentorium. There may be a small amount 
along the left tentorium. A small amount of subarachnoid blood 
may be present along the anterior frontal lobes, as there is 
mildly increased attenuation in the frontal extraaxial spaces. A 
small amount is noted more laterally on the right as well. There 
is no mass effect, shift of normally midline structures, 
hydrocephalus or major vascular territorial infarct. 
Hypoattenuation in the periventricular white matters is 
consistent with chronic microvascular angiopathy. Lacune is 
noted in the left lentiform nucleus. The density values of the 
brain parenchyma are preserved. There is significant mucosal 
thickening and fluid in the paranasal sinuses, most prominent in 
the ethmoid and maxillary sinuses. Osseous structures are 
unremarkable.  IMPRESSION: Small amount of subdural blood 
tracking primarily along the right falx and tentorium. Possible 
small amount of subarachnoid blood in the frontal lobes.
##########################################################
TTE:  The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is 
moderately dilated.  Left ventricular wall thicknesses are 
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is 
mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with 
infero-lateral hypokinesis. The right ventricular cavity is 
mildly dilated. Right ventricular systolic function is 
borderline normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly 
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.  IMPRESSION: 
Mild regional LV hypokinesis c/w CAD. Mildly dilated RV cavity 
with borderline RV systolic function. Mild pulmonary 
hypertension.  
############################################################
 
Brief Hospital Course:
SUBDURAL HEMATOMA:  visualized on CT of head.  No neurologic 
deficits throughout hospitalization.  Neurosurgery evaluation, 
no intervention.
.
ARF:  Cr normalized with IVF.  Likely secondary to hypoperfusion 
in setting of septic shock.
.
SEPTIC SHOCK:  RML PNA on CXR.  BPs improved with 4L NS IVF 
boluses.  Stress dose steroids given.  Underlying cause i.e., 
PNA, treated with Abx.
.
PNA:  gram negative rods in sputum.  Txed with ceftriaxone and 
azithromycin.  Fever curve and symptoms improved with Abx.  Also 
received respiratory PT and nebulizaer treatments.  Still 
required minimal supplemental oxygen at time of discharge.
.
CHF:  TTE showed biventricular systolic dysfunction with 
regional wall motion abnormalities suggestive of coronary 
disease and developing cor pulmonale.  After normalization of 
BPs, titrated up his beta-blocker and ACE, continued aspirin and 
diuresis with lasix improved dyspnea.
.
HTN:  continued metoprolol and lisinopril with adequate control.
.
AFIB:  RVR.  rate controlled with increased BB and added 
digoxin.  No anticoagulation for past year given fall risk.  
.
PULM FIBROSIS:  thought to be secondary to PNA of a year ago.  
On prednisone 20 mg QD at home.  Stress dose given on this 
hospitalization, titrating down at time of discharge.
.
DM2:  continued glargine + metformin + ISS.
.
OSTEOPENIA:  gave calcium, vitamin D, and alendronate

     Contiguous axial images were obtained through the brain.  No contrast was

     CHEST AP PORTABLE SINGLE VIEW.
     
     INDICATION:  History of pneumonia, evaluate lungs.
     
     FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest obtained with patient in semi-erect
     position demonstrates mild cardiac enlargement without typical configurational
     abnormality.  The thoracic aorta is moderately widened and demonstrates linear
     calcium deposits in the wall mostly at the level of the arch.  There is no
     conclusive evidence for any pulmonary vascular congestion but increased
     interstitial markings are noted in the bases consistent with interstitial
     fibrosis.  In the right mid lung field, patchy confluenting densities are
     present which indicate the presence of acute parenchymal infiltrates.  There
     is no evidence of pleural effusions as the lateral pleural sinuses remain free
     on this portable examination.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Parenchymal infiltrate in right-sided mid lung field probably
     representing acute infection, follow up is recommended as there exist no
     previous chest examinations in our records for comparison.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  76-year-old man with pneumonia, shortness of breath.
     
     COMMENTS:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest are reviewed and compared
     to the previous study of yesterday.
     
     The patient has underlying pulmonary emphysema.  There is increase in patchy
     opacity in the right lower lobe indicating pneumonia.  There is worsening of
     congestive heart failure with cardiomegaly.  No pneumothorax is identified. 
     There is small bilateral pleural effusion.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Worsening right lower lobe pneumonia.  Increased congestive heart
     failure with cardiomegaly.

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:   79-year-old with pneumonia.
     
     FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to the prior examination of [**3379-4-17**].  The
     right lower lobe infiltration appears to be less pronounced at this time. 
     Bilateral pleural effusion and bilateral pulmonary vascular congestion. 
     Cardiomegaly is unchanged.  No evidence of pneumothoraces.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pleural effusion and bilateral pulmonary vascular
     congestion are suggestive of congestive heart failure.  The right lower lobe
     infiltration, however, is less pronounced at this time.
