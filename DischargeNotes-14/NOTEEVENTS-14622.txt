HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 10968**] is a 74-year-old
male, who is status post pylorus preserving
pancreaticoduodenectomy [**2764-8-25**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who
presented to the Emergency Department after two episodes of
melanic stools.  The patient had been having normal,
nonbloody bowel movements since the time of discharge from
this hospital on [**2764-9-2**].  The patient states that he began
developing abdominal pain which was sharp in nature without
radiation and located in the epigastrium at approximately 6
pm, the day prior to admission.  He states that this pain was
relieved with a bowel movement.  The patient denied nausea,
vomiting, fevers, and chills, but did complain of diaphoresis
and dizziness.  There was no history of fall or loss of
consciousness.

At the time of arrival, the patient's vitals are 114/67,
blood pressure in the supine position which became 100/palp
in the sitting position.  The patient received 1 liter of
normal saline in route to the hospital, which relieved his
dizziness.  The patient did have symptoms of urinary
retention on [**2764-9-4**], and was seen at [**Hospital3 708**], where
Foley catheter was placed.  Of note, the patient saw his
urologist the day prior to admission, who recommended that
the Foley catheter remain in place for approximately [**3-2**] more
weeks.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Periampullary carcinoma status post pylorus preserving
pancreaticoduodenectomy [**2764-8-25**].
2. Hypertension.
3. Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
4. Pancreatitis.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 97.8, blood
pressure 119/79, heart rate 83, respiratory rate 20, and
oxygen saturation 100% on 2 liters.  General:  Patient is
calm, comfortable, and in no acute distress.  HEENT:
Anicteric sclerae, pink conjunctivae, clear oropharynx, dry
mucous membranes.  Neck is supple and nontender, no
lymphadenopathy.  Heart:  Regular, rate, and rhythm without
murmurs.  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen is soft, nondistended, and nontender, normoactive
bowel sounds.  There are Steri-Strips in the epigastrium
which are clean, dry, and intact.  Rectal examination reveals
normal tone, positive gross blood, no stool.  Genitourinary
examination:  Normal external genitalia.  There is a Foley
catheter in place.  Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or
edema, 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.

LABORATORIES:  Hematocrit 24.3, which was down from 36.0 on
the date of discharge.  PT 13.2, PTT 25, INR 1.2.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Normal sinus rhythm at 80 beats per
minute, there is an isolated ST depression in lead V3.  This
is similar to his prior electrocardiogram.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient presented to the Emergency
Department on [**2764-9-11**].  The patient was resuscitated with IV
fluids and required 5 units of packed red blood cells to
maintain his hematocrit.  In the Emergency Department, a
nasogastric tube was placed, which revealed coffee-grounds,
but no active bleeding.  The patient was started on IV
Protonix, and was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for
monitoring.

On the date of admission, the patient was taken to the GI
Laboratory, where endoscopy was performed.  This demonstrated
a single oozing 6 mm ulcer in the anastomotic site of the
jejunal limb with an adherent clot.  The clot was removed and
hemostasis was achieved using Epinephrine and electrocautery.

The patient spent one night in the Intensive Care Unit for
monitoring, was started on clear liquids the following day,
and was transferred to the [**Hospital3 **] floor in good
condition.  The patient maintained stable vital signs, was
able to tolerate a house diet, and maintained his hematocrit
at 34 x2.  He was then discharged to home on [**2764-9-13**] in
stable condition, and told to followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
approximately one week.

     CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST.
     
     INDICATION:  Post pylorus-sparing Whipple with wound infection.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically-acquired images were obtained from the lung bases
     through the pubic symphysis after 150 cc Optiray.  Non-ionic contrast was
     provided due to the patient's generalized debility.  Coronal images were
     constructed.
     
     CT ABDOMEN AFTER IV CONTRAST:  There is atelectasis at the lung bases and tiny
     bilateral pleural effusions.  There is atelectasis adjacent to an ectatic
     aorta.
     
     The patient's open wound is seen to the right of midline in the upper abdomen.
     Beneath the incision, inferior to the liver and adjacent to the pancreato-
     jejunal anastamosis is a low- density fluid collection that is nearly
     completely surrounded by a thin enhancing rim. The collection measures
     approximately 7 cm in width and ranges in depth from 2 cm to 4 cm. There is
     mild thickening of the jejunum at the anastamosis with the pancreas.  The
     proximal aspect of the jejunum is dilated to 3 cm and is mildly thickened. The
     jejunum tapers to normal caliber anterior to the aorta.
     
     Contrast passes through the gastrojejunostomy into the small bowel and colon.
     There are no dilated loops of bowel.  There is no bowel wall thickening.  The
     sigmoid colon is collapsed but there is no evidence of bowel wall thickening.
     
     CT PELVIS AFTER IV CONTRAST:  The kidneys, adrenal glands, remaining pancreas,
     and spleen are normal  Granulomas are see in the spleen and liver.  There are
     scattered nodes within the mesentery and retroperitoneum. The bladder contains
     a Foley and is collapsed. There is no free pelvic air or pelvic fluid.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  74 year old man with descending aortic dissection.
     
     COMPARISON:  Examination is being compared with the prior CT performed on
     [**2764-9-15**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images were acquired through the chest, abdomen,
     and pelvis at 5 mm intervals before the administration of IV contrast. Then,
     contiguous axial images were acquired through this same region at 5 mm
     intervals after the uneventful administration of 100 cc of Optiray contrast
     media intravenously after rapid bolus injection.
     
     CTA OF THE AORTA AND CT RECONSTRUCTIONS:  Multiplanar and volume rendering
     reconstructions were performed at the workstation and significantly enhanced
     the evaluation of this case.
     
     There is significant atheromatous disease.
     
     There is evidence of a complex [**Location (un) 5272**]-type B dissection at the inferior
     thoracic/upper abdominal aorta where a true and false lumen are clearly
     visualized and filled with contrast.  These are visualized between the mid
     thoracic aorta and the superior abdominal aorta for a length of approximately
     8.6 cm.  An apparently thrombosed false lumen is seen medial to the upper
     thoracic aorta extending from just distal to the takeoff of the left
     subclavian artery inferiorly to the mid thoracic aorta for a length of
     approximately 12 cm.  Active contrast extravasation is seen into this
     apparently thrombosed false lumen at least at 3 locations.
     
     An ulcerated atheromatous plaque is seen at the inferior aspect of the aortic
     arch, measuring 1.6 x 1.0 cm.  A larger focal ulcerated plaque/flap is seen at
     the anterior distal thoracic/upper abdominal aorta and does not appear to
     extend cephalad or caudally.  An additional ulcerated plaque is seen inferior
     to the origin of the right renal artery and measures 1.3 cm in diameter.  
     
     The diameter of the aorta at the level of the upper abdominal aorta, just
     superior to the take off of the celiac axis is 3.7 cm.  It tapers down to 2.8
     x 2.6 cm at the level of the right renal artery origin.  An infrarenal aortic
     aneurysm is not seen.
     
     The celiac axis and branches, superior mesenteric artery and branches and the
                                                                 (Over)

     renal arteries are patent and demonstrate normal vascular distribution.  The
     proximal inferior mesenteric artery is likewise patent.
     
     CT CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The apices were not completely imaged on
     this chest CTA.  Emphysematous changes are seen at the lung apices.  There is
     evidence of bilateral pleural effusions with associated compressive
     atelectasis, worse on the left side.  No lung masses are visualized.  Multiple
     anterior mediastinal lymph nodes are seen, the largest measuring 1.1 x 0.6 cm
     in diameter.  Small precarinal lymph nodes are seen showing evidence of hilar
     fat within.
     
     No significant axillary lymphadenpathy is seen.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Multiple calcified granulomas are
     seen within the liver.  No liver masses are seen.  There is no evidence of
     intra or extrahepatic biliary duct dilatation.  A normal gallbladder is not
     seen.  Various small calcified granulomas are also seen at the spleen.  The
     adrenal glands, and pancreas are normal.  The kidneys demonstrate symmetric
     contrast enhancement and excretion.  A simple renal cyst is seen on the right
     side measuring 1.3 x 0.8 cm in diameter.  There is no evidence of
     hydronephrosis.
     
     No significant intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal lymph nodes are seen.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH/WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  A Foley catheter is seen within
     the bladder.  The prostate measures 4.9 x 2.9 cm in diameter.  The rectum is
     unremarkable.  There is no evidence of pathologic intrapelvic or inguinal
     lymphadenopathy.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  Other than degenerative changes of the spine, no suspicious
     osseous lesions are seen.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     There is evidence of a complex [**Location (un) **] type B aortic dissection as described
     above.  Areas of contrast extravasation are seen into an apparently thrombosed
     false lumen.  Multiple ulcerated atheromatous plaques are seen, specifically
     at the aortic arch and the superior aspect of the abdominal aorta.
     
     There are bilateral pleural effusions with associated compressive atelectasis.
     
     The prostate gland is enlarged.

     CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST
     
     INDICATION: 74 year old male with aneurysmal dissection of the thoracic aorta
     and possible pulmonary embolism.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Axial CT imaging of the chest performed after the IV administration
     of 100 cc Optiray.  Nonionic contrast used due to patient debility. Comparison
     is made to a prior CT of the chest performed the same day.  Additional
     reformatted imaging in the coronal and sagittal planes also performed.
     
     FINDINGS: There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism.  There is an unchanged
     appearance of three small pools of contrast within the patient's hematoma near
     the aortic arch.  There is marked atherosclerotic disease within the thoracic
     aorta with evidence of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5272**] type B dissection originating just beyond
     the arch of the aorta.  The caudal extent of this dissection is not evaluated
     on this examination.  There is probable hematoma surrounding the patient's
     descending thoracic aorta.  The overall size of the patient's thoracic aorta
     appears stable when compared to the prior examination performed seven hours
     previously.  The heart, pericardium, and pulmonary arteries are within normal
     limits.  There are bilateral pleural effusions (left greater than right) with
     resultant compressive atelectasis. The lungs are clear with a tiny nodular
     opacity identified within the right lung base measuring less than 1 cm.  There
     is evidence of emphysematous change within both lung apices. Within the
     visualized portion of the upper abdomen, limited views of the liver are within
     normal limits with several calcified granulomas. Bone windows show no
     suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
     
     REFORMATTED IMAGING:  Images reformatted in multiple planes were essential in
     evaluating the pulmonary arterial vasculature and demonstrate no evidence of
     definite pulmonary embolism.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) No pulmonary embolism.
     
     2) Stable size of the thoracic aorta with [**Location (un) 5272**] type B dissection and

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  74 year old man with descending aortic dissection.
     
     COMPARISON:  Examination is being compared with the prior CT performed on
     [**2764-9-15**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images were acquired through the chest, abdomen,
     and pelvis at 5 mm intervals before the administration of IV contrast. Then,
     contiguous axial images were acquired through this same region at 5 mm
     intervals after the uneventful administration of 100 cc of Optiray contrast
     media intravenously after rapid bolus injection.
     
     CTA OF THE AORTA AND CT RECONSTRUCTIONS:  Multiplanar and volume rendering
     reconstructions were performed at the workstation and significantly enhanced
     the evaluation of this case.
     
     There is significant atheromatous disease.
     
     There is evidence of a complex [**Location (un) 5272**]-type B dissection at the inferior
     thoracic/upper abdominal aorta where a true and false lumen are clearly
     visualized and filled with contrast.  These are visualized between the mid
     thoracic aorta and the superior abdominal aorta for a length of approximately
     8.6 cm.  An apparently thrombosed false lumen is seen medial to the upper
     thoracic aorta extending from just distal to the takeoff of the left
     subclavian artery inferiorly to the mid thoracic aorta for a length of
     approximately 12 cm.  Active contrast extravasation is seen into this
     apparently thrombosed false lumen at least at 3 locations.
     
     An ulcerated atheromatous plaque is seen at the inferior aspect of the aortic
     arch, measuring 1.6 x 1.0 cm.  A larger focal ulcerated plaque/flap is seen at
     the anterior distal thoracic/upper abdominal aorta and does not appear to
     extend cephalad or caudally.  An additional ulcerated plaque is seen inferior
     to the origin of the right renal artery and measures 1.3 cm in diameter.  
     
     The diameter of the aorta at the level of the upper abdominal aorta, just
     superior to the take off of the celiac axis is 3.7 cm.  It tapers down to 2.8
     x 2.6 cm at the level of the right renal artery origin.  An infrarenal aortic
     aneurysm is not seen.
     
     The celiac axis and branches, superior mesenteric artery and branches and the
                                                                 (Over)

     renal arteries are patent and demonstrate normal vascular distribution.  The
     proximal inferior mesenteric artery is likewise patent.
     
     CT CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The apices were not completely imaged on
     this chest CTA.  Emphysematous changes are seen at the lung apices.  There is
     evidence of bilateral pleural effusions with associated compressive
     atelectasis, worse on the left side.  No lung masses are visualized.  Multiple
     anterior mediastinal lymph nodes are seen, the largest measuring 1.1 x 0.6 cm
     in diameter.  Small precarinal lymph nodes are seen showing evidence of hilar
     fat within.
     
     No significant axillary lymphadenpathy is seen.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Multiple calcified granulomas are
     seen within the liver.  No liver masses are seen.  There is no evidence of
     intra or extrahepatic biliary duct dilatation.  A normal gallbladder is not
     seen.  Various small calcified granulomas are also seen at the spleen.  The
     adrenal glands, and pancreas are normal.  The kidneys demonstrate symmetric
     contrast enhancement and excretion.  A simple renal cyst is seen on the right
     side measuring 1.3 x 0.8 cm in diameter.  There is no evidence of
     hydronephrosis.
     
     No significant intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal lymph nodes are seen.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH/WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  A Foley catheter is seen within
     the bladder.  The prostate measures 4.9 x 2.9 cm in diameter.  The rectum is
     unremarkable.  There is no evidence of pathologic intrapelvic or inguinal
     lymphadenopathy.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  Other than degenerative changes of the spine, no suspicious
     osseous lesions are seen.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     There is evidence of a complex [**Location (un) **] type B aortic dissection as described
     above.  Areas of contrast extravasation are seen into an apparently thrombosed
     false lumen.  Multiple ulcerated atheromatous plaques are seen, specifically
     at the aortic arch and the superior aspect of the abdominal aorta.
     
     There are bilateral pleural effusions with associated compressive atelectasis.
     
     The prostate gland is enlarged.

     MRI OF THE CHEST AND MRA DATED [**2764-10-23**].
     
     INDICATION:  The patient is a 74 year-old male with thoracic aortic
     dissection.  Please evaluate for progression.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images were performed prior to the
     administration of contrast.  Additionally, gadolinium enhanced dynamic 3D
     gradient-echo T1-weighted images were obtained.  Maximum intensity projection
     and multiplanar reformatted images were obtained on a 3D workstation.
     
     FINDINGS:  Severe atherosclerotic changes are seen throughout the thoracic
     aorta, including multiple penetrating atheromatous ulcers.  The thoracic aorta
     is aneurysmally dilated.  The ascending aorta measures a maximum or 4.1 x 3.7

     INDICATION:  The patient is a 74 year-old male with thoracic aortic
     dissection.  Please evaluate for progression.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images were performed prior to the
     administration of contrast.  Additionally, gadolinium enhanced dynamic 3D
     gradient-echo T1-weighted images were obtained.  Maximum intensity projection
     and multiplanar reformatted images were obtained on a 3D workstation.
     
     FINDINGS:  Severe atherosclerotic changes are seen throughout the thoracic
     aorta, including multiple penetrating atheromatous ulcers.  The thoracic aorta
     is aneurysmally dilated.  The ascending aorta measures a maximum or 4.1 x 3.7
     cm in transverse diameter measured in the true orthagonal plane.  The
     decending thoracic aorta measures a maximum of 3.8 x 3.4 cm in transverse
     diameter, again measured in a true orthagonal plane.  A large intramural
     hematoma is seen extending from just distal to the left subclavian artery,
     through the descending thoracic aorta.  There is also a focal dissection in
     the mid-distal descending thoracic aorta, over a length of approximately 7 cm.
     Bilateral pleural effusions are present.

     INDICATION: History of aortic dissection. Evaluate status of effusions.
     
     FINDINGS: A single AP semi-upright view. Comparison study dated [**2764-10-23**]. There is again evidence of fairly marked left ventricular enlargement of
     the heart and some unfolding of the aorta. The pulmonary vessels show upper
     zone redistribution. This suggests some left heart failure though it may be
     markedly postural. There is again evidence of left lower lobe collapse and
     consolidation associated with a small left effusion. Some minor atelectasis is
     also noted in the right lower zone.
     
     IMPRESSION: There is apparently worsening left heart failure since the prior
     study. There is also persistent left lower lobe collapse/consolidation.

     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1 and T2W images, and reconstruction images of the

     CHEST MRI W/O GADOLINIUM:  There is aneurysmal dilatation of the thoracic
     aorta.  There is a large intramural hematoma of the thoracic aorta extending
     from immediately distal to the left subclavian artery to the descending
     thoracic aorta, now showing higher signal, the typical evolution of intramural
     hematoma. Focal dissection is seen in the mid distal descending thoracic
     aorta. There are bilateral pleural effusions. All these findings are unchanged
     since [**2764-10-23**].
     
     MR reconstruction images were essential for delineating the pathology
     described above.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No change since [**2764-10-23**] in the size and with some
     expected increase in signal intensity of the intramural hematoma.  The intimal

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Aortic dissection.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MR angiography of the thoracic aorta was performed utilizing the
     following sequences:  axial DB HASTE images, axial T1-weighted images, axial
     true FISP images, axial 2D time-of-flight images, and sagittal VIBE images
     prior to and following the intravenous administration of gadolinium.
     Comparison is made to the MR examinations of chest dated [**2764-10-29**] and
     [**2764-10-23**].  Three-dimensional reconstructions were generated on an image
     processing workstation.
     
     FINDINGS:
     MR CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  Again noted is an intramural hematoma and dissection
     tract within the descending aorta approximately 12 cm distal to the left
     subclavian artery involving the posterior wall of the aorta.  At least two
     other regions of intramural high T1 signal are seen within the more distal
     aorta, also representing intramural hematoma.  These regions have all
     diminished in volume since the previous examinations, however, the most
     proximal dissection tract is slightly longer.  There is no significant
     compromise of the aortic lumen.  The ascending aorta measures 3.7 cm in
     diameter.  The descending aorta measures 3.1 cm in diameter.
     
     The origins of the great vessels are normal.  No dissection flap is
     identified.
     
     There are small bilateral pleural effusions, improved from the previous
     examination.  The adjacent lung demonstrates no consolidation or enhancing
     mass.
     
     No enlarged regional lymph nodes are identified.  The visualized osseous
     structures and muscle groups appear unremarkable.
     
     Review of reconstructed images was essential in confirming the above findings.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Ulcerating plaque of the descending aorta with intramural hematoma,
     predominantly involving the posterior aorta 12 cm distal to the left
     subclavian artery.  There has been interval resolution of the volume of
     hematoma, although the posterior dissection tract is slightly longer.
     
     Resolving bilateral pleural effusions.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  History of ampullar adenocarinoma status post Whipple's disease.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically-acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     lung bases to the pubic symphysis after the administration of 150 cc of IV
     Optiray.  Nonionic contrast was used secondary to the patient's history of
     allergy.  Pre-contrast and portal venous phase imaging of the liver was
     obtained.
     
     COMPARISON:  Prior CT from [**2764-9-15**].
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:  A small, pleural-based nodule
     is again identified within the left lower lobe, stable in appearance from the
     prior study.  No new lung nodules, parenchymal opacities, or pleural effusions
     are identified in the lung bases.  There has been interval development of
     numerous, enhancing, low-attenuation lesions throughout the liver, consistent
     with metastatic disease.  Numerous punctate calcifications are again seen
     within the liver and spleen.  The portal vein is patent.  The spleen otherwise
     appears unremarkable.  The remainder of the pancreas, adrenal glands,
     opacified loops of large and small bowel, and ureters appear unremarkable.
     Within the lower pole of the left kidney, there is a small, approximately 3
     mm, low-attenuation lesion present, too small to full characterize.  Within
     the right kidney, there is a 9 mm, well-defined, low-attenuation lesion
     consistent with a simple cyst.  Scarring is noted within the midpole of the
     right kidney.  An ill-defined area of hyperdensity is noted within the lower
     pole of the right kidney on the non-contrast series, which may represent
     calcium.  Both kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete normally.  New large
     lymph nodes are identified within the root of the mesentery which have
     hypodense centers, findings consistent with necrotic nodes. The largest lymph
     node conglomerate measures 2.0 x 3.6 cm.  Multiple small mesenteric and
     retroperitoneal lymph nodes are again identified, some of which appear smaller
     than the prior study.  There is no free fluid or free air identified.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  There has been interval increase in size
     and number of nodes within both inguinal regions, the largest measuring 1 cm,
     located within the left inguinal region.  Scattered, small pelvic lymph nodes
     are again identified, which appear stable from the prior exam, and none of
     which meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.  The rectum, sigmoid colon,
     distal ureters, bladder, and prostate appear unremarkable.  There is no free
     fluid.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified.
                                                                 (Over)

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Evaluate status of disease.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Ampullary adenocarcinoma.  Evaluate status of disease.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  CT of the torso was performed using the oncology protocol.  150 cc
     of Optiray non-ionic contrast was given due to history of hypertension.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2765-3-15**].
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST: There is no axillary, mediastinal, or hilar
     lymphadenopathy. Small AP window and pretracheal lymph nodes are not
     significantly changed since the prior chest CT of [**2764-10-21**].  Coronary artery
     calcifications are again seen. There is a substantial decrease in the size of
     aortic wall hematoma.  A small region of ulceration into the hematoma/plaque
     is seen in the mid-descending thoracic aorta.  There are small, sub-cm
     subpleural nodules in the superior right lower lobe, in the right middle lobe,
     and in the left lower lobe.  While the left lower lobe nodule was seen on the
     prior chest CT, the other two were not seen, perhaps due to the degree of
     atelectasis present on the prior study. There is no effusion, pneumothorax, or
     evidence of pneumonia on today's study.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST:  There are scattered
     calcifications throughout the liver, unchanged, and the multiple hepatic
     masses are probably unchanged in number as well.  However, while some of these
     lesions may have the appearance of decreasing in size (at the dome of the
     liver, a previously 2.4-cm mass now measures 2.0 cm), many of these are
     slightly larger or at least more conspicuous (measuring 23 mm from 19 mm in
     the inferior aspect of segment 3).  A mass in the superior aspect of segment 3
     has grown from 19 to 26 mm.  The spleen also contains multiple calcifications.
     The pancreatic body and tail, adrenal glands, and stomach appear to be within
     normal limits.  Soft-tissue densities adjacent to the mesenteric vessels along
     the SMA are smaller on today's study than on the prior.  A conglomerate
     mesenteric nodal mass which was 3.8 x 2.5 cm now measures 2.6 x 2.1 cm, with
     less surrounding stranding.  Several tiny hypodense foci within the left
     kidney and sub-cm foci within the right kidney are too small to characterize.
     There is a wedge-shaped defect in the cortex of the right kidney superiorly,
     probably focal scarring.  There is a small nonobstrucitve herniation of small
     bowel through the anterior left abdominal wall. There is no significant
     abdominal lymphadenopathy or free fluid.  Small and shotty unchanged
     retroperitoneal lymph nodes are present. Minimal mesenteric nodularity at the
     midline just superior to the umbilicus is not significantly changed.
                                                                 (Over)

     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The large bowel, bladder, and distal ureters
     are within normal limits.  The prostate is enlarged.  There is no pelvic
     lymphadenopathy or free fluid.  A right-sided hydrocele is present.
     
     Examination of the osseous structures shows no suspicious lytic or blastic
     lesions.  There is substantial calcification of the abdominal aorta.  There is
     also a fusiform dilatation of the thoracic aorta, up to 4 cm in size.  Aortic
     size has been stable.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) Multiple hepatic lesions are significantly more conspicuous on today's
     study than on the prior study, and mostly have increased slightly in size.
     
     2) The conglomerate mesenteric mass has decreased in size.
     
     3) Small, sub-cm lung nodules were not apparent on the prior study, although

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      74 year old man with ampullar adenocarcinoma, on therapy.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Evaluate status of disease.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Ampullary adenocarcinoma.  Evaluate status of disease.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  CT of the torso was performed using the oncology protocol.  150 cc
     of Optiray non-ionic contrast was given due to history of hypertension.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2765-3-15**].
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST: There is no axillary, mediastinal, or hilar
     lymphadenopathy. Small AP window and pretracheal lymph nodes are not
     significantly changed since the prior chest CT of [**2764-10-21**].  Coronary artery
     calcifications are again seen. There is a substantial decrease in the size of
     aortic wall hematoma.  A small region of ulceration into the hematoma/plaque
     is seen in the mid-descending thoracic aorta.  There are small, sub-cm
     subpleural nodules in the superior right lower lobe, in the right middle lobe,
     and in the left lower lobe.  While the left lower lobe nodule was seen on the
     prior chest CT, the other two were not seen, perhaps due to the degree of
     atelectasis present on the prior study. There is no effusion, pneumothorax, or
     evidence of pneumonia on today's study.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST:  There are scattered
     calcifications throughout the liver, unchanged, and the multiple hepatic
     masses are probably unchanged in number as well.  However, while some of these
     lesions may have the appearance of decreasing in size (at the dome of the
     liver, a previously 2.4-cm mass now measures 2.0 cm), many of these are
     slightly larger or at least more conspicuous (measuring 23 mm from 19 mm in
     the inferior aspect of segment 3).  A mass in the superior aspect of segment 3
     has grown from 19 to 26 mm.  The spleen also contains multiple calcifications.
     The pancreatic body and tail, adrenal glands, and stomach appear to be within
     normal limits.  Soft-tissue densities adjacent to the mesenteric vessels along
     the SMA are smaller on today's study than on the prior.  A conglomerate
     mesenteric nodal mass which was 3.8 x 2.5 cm now measures 2.6 x 2.1 cm, with
     less surrounding stranding.  Several tiny hypodense foci within the left
     kidney and sub-cm foci within the right kidney are too small to characterize.
     There is a wedge-shaped defect in the cortex of the right kidney superiorly,
     probably focal scarring.  There is a small nonobstrucitve herniation of small
     bowel through the anterior left abdominal wall. There is no significant
     abdominal lymphadenopathy or free fluid.  Small and shotty unchanged
     retroperitoneal lymph nodes are present. Minimal mesenteric nodularity at the
     midline just superior to the umbilicus is not significantly changed.
                                                                 (Over)

     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The large bowel, bladder, and distal ureters
     are within normal limits.  The prostate is enlarged.  There is no pelvic
     lymphadenopathy or free fluid.  A right-sided hydrocele is present.
     
     Examination of the osseous structures shows no suspicious lytic or blastic
     lesions.  There is substantial calcification of the abdominal aorta.  There is
     also a fusiform dilatation of the thoracic aorta, up to 4 cm in size.  Aortic
     size has been stable.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) Multiple hepatic lesions are significantly more conspicuous on today's
     study than on the prior study, and mostly have increased slightly in size.
     
     2) The conglomerate mesenteric mass has decreased in size.

      75 year old man with gallbladder cancer, currently on treatment.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Evaluate status of disease.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL HISTORY:  75 year old male with gallbladder cancer, referred for re-
     evaluation of disease status.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images were obtained from the thoracic inlet
     through the symphysis pubis following the administration of 150 cc of Optiray.
      Non-ionic contrast was used due to patient hypertension.  Non-contrast-
     enhanced and early phase images of the abdomen were included.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2765-5-17**].
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  As before, there are several prominent
     pretracheal, precarinal, and prevascular lymph nodes.  The largest of these is
     located in the precarinal region and measures 1.5 x 1.4 cm.  No hilar or
     axillary lymphadenopathy is present.  The heart and great vessels are grossly
     normal in appearance.  As before, there are mild right apical emphysematous
     changes and scarring.  Multiple tiny bilateral pulmonary nodules are unchanged
     in size and number.  There are no pleural or pericardial effusions.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:  As before, there are multiple
     liver masses, all of which have increased in size.  There is a lesion at the
     dome of the liver which currently measures 3.2 x 3.2 cm and previously
     measured 2.1 x 2.2 cm.  There is a lesion within the inferior right lobe which
     measures 3.7 x 3.7 cm, and previously measured 2.7 x 2.7 cm. Multiple
     additional lesions have increased in size as well.  Scattered calcifications
     throughout the liver and spleen likely represent sequelae from prior
     granulomatous disease.  The portal vein and its branches are patent. There is
     no intrahepatic ductal dilatation.  The pancreas, adrenal glands, and left
     kidney are grossly normal.  There is a stable appearing right renal cyst, as
     well as an area of cortical irregularity which likely reflects scarring. The
     stomach and visualized bowel loops are grossly normal.  There has been no
     appreciable interval change in the size or appearance of the ill-defined
     mesenteric mass.  The aorta and its major branches are patent, although
     extensive atheromatous disease is noted.  There is stable appearing thoracic
     aortic aneurysm which measures 4.4 cm in diameter and is present just above
     the level of the celiac artery.  No free fluid is present.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The urinary bladder, distal ureters and
     seminal vesicles are unremarkable.  There is moderate prostatic enlargement.
     There is sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.  No free
     fluid is present within the pelvis.
