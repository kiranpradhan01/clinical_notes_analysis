                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  78-year-old man with metastatic prostate cancer with acute onset
     of left lower quadrant pain.  Evaluate for nephrolithiasis versus
     pyelonephritis.
     
     No comparison studies.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT acquired axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained
     without IV contrast.  60 minute delayed images post-IV contrast administration
     were then performed.  Multiplanar reformations were obtained.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:  The liver, gallbladder, pancreas,
     spleen, adrenal glands are within normal limits.  The left kidney demonstrates
     moderate hydronephrosis with associated mild to moderate hydroureter.  A
     transition point is seen in the distal ureter (series 3, image 64).  No
     radiopaque stone is visualized.  No specific soft tissue density is seen
     encompassing the transition point post-contrast administration.  Contrast is
     not seen reaching transition point.  Within the left kidney, there are two
     simple cysts, one in the mid pole, one in the lower pole.  The right kidney is
     unremarkable with no evidence of hydronephrosis, hydroureter, or stones. There
     is bilateral stranding seen surrounding both kidneys.  Both kidneys appear of
     the same size.  The small bowel is unremarkable.  There is no free fluid or
     free air.
     
     CT PELVIS:  Within the sigmoid colon, there are multiple small diverticuli
     with no evidence of diverticulitis.  Multiple calcifications are seen within
     the prostate gland.  There is no free fluid, lymphadenopathy, soft tissue
     masses within the pelvis.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  Sclerotic lesions are seen within the left acetabulum and iliac
     bone.  Sclerotic lesions are seen within the entire L2 vertebral body.  Mild
     sclerotic lesions are seen within the L5 and S1 vertebral bodies.  These
     lesions are suspicious for metastatic lesions given history of prostate
     cancer.

     radiopaque stone is visualized.  No specific soft tissue density is seen
     encompassing the transition point post-contrast administration.  Contrast is
     not seen reaching transition point.  Within the left kidney, there are two
     simple cysts, one in the mid pole, one in the lower pole.  The right kidney is
     unremarkable with no evidence of hydronephrosis, hydroureter, or stones. There
     is bilateral stranding seen surrounding both kidneys.  Both kidneys appear of
     the same size.  The small bowel is unremarkable.  There is no free fluid or
     free air.
     
     CT PELVIS:  Within the sigmoid colon, there are multiple small diverticuli
     with no evidence of diverticulitis.  Multiple calcifications are seen within
     the prostate gland.  There is no free fluid, lymphadenopathy, soft tissue
     masses within the pelvis.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  Sclerotic lesions are seen within the left acetabulum and iliac
     bone.  Sclerotic lesions are seen within the entire L2 vertebral body.  Mild
     sclerotic lesions are seen within the L5 and S1 vertebral bodies.  These
     lesions are suspicious for metastatic lesions given history of prostate
     cancer.

     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Moderate left hydronephrosis with associated mild-to-moderate left
     hydroureter.  Transition point seen in the distal left ureter with no definite
     evidence of radiopaque stone.  No significant soft tissue surrounding the
     transition point.  Possibilities for obstruction include metastatic stricture
     or nonradiopaque stone.
     
     2.  No evidence of pyelonephritis.
     
     3.  Left simple renal cysts.
     
     4.  Diverticulosis with no evidence of diverticulitis.
     
     5.  Multiple sclerotic lesions within the pelvis and lumbar spine, likely
     representing metastatic disease.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Prostate cancer.  Multiple sclerotic foci on recent prior CT scan.   
     Assess for osseous metastases. 
      
     INTERPRETATION:   
      
     Whole body images of the skeleton were obtained in anterior and posterior
     projections. 
      
     There are multifocal areas of abnormal tracer uptake consistent with metastatic
     disease.  These are seen within bilateral ribs, within the L2, L5, and S1
     vertebral bodies, and within the pelvis (left much greater than right,
     corresponding to the CT findings).  There is uptake within the left knee and
     foot, and within the right ankle, likely degenerative.  Photopenic defects at
     the right knee likely represent knee replacement.  The left collecting system
     and ureter are dilated. 
      
     Comparison was made to the CT abdomen/pelvis of [**2606-3-21**]. 
      
     The kidneys and urinary bladder are visualized, the normal route of tracer
     excretion. 
      
     IMPRESSION:  Findings consistent with metastatic disease to the ribs, spine, and
     pelvis.  Findings relayed to [**Doctor First Name 11804**] at Dr.[**Doctor Last Name 11805**] office at 1:55pm on

     COMPARISON:  [**2606-3-21**].
     
     INDICATION:  Cough and gurgling.
     
     The heart size is normal.  There is slight upper zone vascular redistribution.
     There is new perihilar haziness and peribronchial cuffing.  No confluent areas
     of consolidation are observed in either lung, and there are no pleural
     effusions.  The bones are diffusely demineralized.
     
     Permanent pacemaker is noted with leads in the right atrium and right
     ventricle.  Redundancy of the ventricular lead within the right atrium is
     noted unchanged.
     
     IMPRESSION:  New perihilar haziness and peribronchial cuffing.  This could
     be due to interstitial edema from fluid overload, but differential diagnosis
     includes viral infection and PCP.
