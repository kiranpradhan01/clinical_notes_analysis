Service: SURGERY
 
Allergies: 
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs
 
Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8176**] 
Chief Complaint:
B/L life threatning leg ischemia
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2542-7-13**]

1.  Left  axillobifemoral  bypass  graft  using 6 mm ringed
    polytetrafluoroethylene.
2.  Re-do/revision.

[**2542-7-14**]

1.  Right femoral thromboembolectomy.
2.  Intraoperative angiogram, performance and S and I.

 
History of Present Illness:
The  patient  is  a 68 year old male with end stage    lung   
cancer   who   has   undergone   a   previous axillobifemoral 
bypass graft for lung ischemia.  He presented with  an  
occlusion  several  months  ago  but could not have surgery  due 
 to  his  chemotherapy regimen.  He now presents with  limb  
threatening  ischemia of both legs, right greater than  left.    
After  intravenous  heparin therapy and repeat angiogram,  he  
was  taken to the Operating Room.  The family and  patient  were 
aware of his critical medical condition as well  as  the  
possibility  that  even with a revision of his
bypass graft, he may still have the potential for limb loss.

 
Past Medical History:
Past medical history is significant for lung cancer that is
metastatic to the neck and hilum that is being treated with
chemotherapy and is being monitored by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] from The
Cancer Center of [**Location (un) **]. 

Also past medical history is significant for pancytopenia with 
anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia

He also has a history of pericardial infusion with approximately 
1200 cc of bloody fluid removed from the pericardial sac in 
December without recurrence.

Patient's primary care doctor is Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 10978**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4442**], who is
part of [**Hospital6 **] Medical Associates, phone number
is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10979**].

Past surgical history is significant for laparoscopic 
cholecystectomy, exploratory laparotomy for cancer, and
questionable partial colectomy for diverticulitis.
 
Social History:
pos alcohol remote
tobacco abuse remote 
 
Family History:
non contributary
 
Physical Exam:
Physical examination upon admit revealed a well-developed and
well-nourished, ill appearing.
 
His neck was supple without evidence of jugular venous 
distention or
carotid bruits. 

The heart was sinus tachycardia without murmer 
without evidence of murmur. 

Lungs scattered rhonchi

Abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended
with a well-healed midline scar.

CLINICAL/LAB DATA: Mr. [**Known patient lastname 10980**] is a 68-year-old man, s/p left 
axillobifemoral bypass for bilateral lower extremity ischemia. 
He 
developed fever and respiratory distres during the transfusion 
of a 
unit of RBC on [**2542-7-18**]. His temperatoure was elevated from 99.3F 
to 
101.0F. The transfusion was stopped after about 200 ml of RBC 
was 
transfused. According to the note from nurse and on-call 
resident, 
before tranfusion, the patient had two episodes of fever 
(>101.4) over 
the previous 48 hours, and a few hours before transfusion, he 
was noted 
to have shortness of breath and tachycardia. He was coded and 
expired in 
the early morning of [**2542-7-19**].

INTRO AORTA FEM/AXIL  

Reason: assess RLE circulation 

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
68 year old man with cold right foot acutely 
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
assess RLE circulation 
HISTORY: 68-year-old male presents with right cold foot. The 
patient is status post right axillary-bifemoral bypass which is 
now occluded as seen by duplex ultrasound.

RADIOLOGISTS: The procedure was performed by Drs. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and 
[**Name5 (PTitle) **] [**Doctor Last Name **] d'Othee with the attending radiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] 
[**Name (STitle) 10982**] being present in the entire procedure.

FINDINGS: The angiograms showed occlusion of the abdominal aorta 
just below the takeoff of the inferior mesenteric artery ([**Female First Name (un) **]). 
The celiac trunk, superior mesenteric artery and single right 
and double left renal arteries are opacified. The [**Female First Name (un) **] is 
prominent. There are also some lumbar arteries visualized giving 
collateral circulation.

On the right, the iliac vessels and common femoral artery are 
not opacified. The superficial femoral artery and profunda 
femoris are reconstituted just below their takeoff and patent. 
The right popliteal artery is faintly opacified but appears 
patent up to its bifurcation in the anterior tibial artery and 
the tibioperoneal trunk, both of which are faintly opacified in 
their proximal portions.

On the left, the iliac arteries and proximal common femoral 
artery are not opacified. The distal common femoral, profunda 
femoris, superficial femoral and popliteal arteries are patent 
with no severe stenosis, and their opacification appears earlier 
than on the left side. The tibioperoneal trunk and posterior 
tibial arteries are faintly opacified.

Below the level of the knees, contrast is too diluted to allow 
good diagnostic image quality.

CONTRAST: A total of approximately 160 cc of Conray 30% were 
given intraarterially for the angiograms.

IMPRESSION:

1. Occlusion of the distal abdominal aorta just below the [**Female First Name (un) **] 
takeoff.

2. The bilateral iliac arteries, the right common femoral and 
proximal left common femoral arteries are not patent.

3. No graft was visualized.

4. Patency of the bilateral SFAs and popliteal arteries, with 
slower flow in the right than the left side.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
pt admitted [**2542-7-12**] for acute rle ischemia

Heparin started stat

[**2542-7-12**]

Pt underwent a: 

1.  Left  axillobifemoral  bypass  graft  using 6 mm ringed 
polytetrafluoroethylene.
2.  Re-do/revision.
 
After the procedure, the  patient  remained  in  somewhat  
critical  condition  on
pressors  and ventilator.  He was taken to the Intensive Care 
Unit. His  right foot was still blue and somewhat mottled,but  
the  grafts  were  clearly patent.  Decision was made to observe 
 the  patient,  stabilize his blood pressure, and get him off 
pressors. 

[**2542-7-13**] 

Pt remained in the SICU. He was sedated on a variety of drips 
for blood presssure control.

[**2542-7-14**]

One day  after  left  axillobifemoral  bypass for bilateral 
lower extremity ischemia, right greater than left. Mr [**Known patient lastname 10980**] 
required a significant amount of pressors to maintain a blood  
pressure.  Over the course of the day, his requirement of  
pressors  diminished.   

Mr [**Known patient lastname 10980**] right foot still was fairly  mottled and there was 
concern of distal thrombus.  In addition,  there  was a clear 
difference between the left and
right foot, indicating potential for a unilateral problem.

Because of this the  patient  was  brought semi-urgently to the 
operating  room.   He was already sedated. This was added to by  
the anesthesia staff during the procedure.

Mr [**Known patient lastname 10980**] then underwent a second procedure for his ischemic 
limb.

1.  Right femoral thromboembolectomy.
2.  Intraoperative angiogram, performance and S and I.

During the procedure it was thought that  there was nothing 
technically that could
be  fixed,  this  was  either  related to spasm of the distal 
vessels from chronic ischemia and the pressors, or related to 
thrombus  in  the distal vessels.

At  this  point, the decision was made to do nothing further, 
since there was no bypass situation that could be expected to be 
successful. Plan was to continue to resuscitate the patient, and 
get the patient off pressors and hopefully this
would solve the problem.

Also  of note, since there was concern about a white platelet 
plug, decision was  made to stop all heparin and switch the 
patient eventually to Hirudin.

After the procedue there was a strongly palpable graft pulse,  
and  a  palpable  pulse  in  the  femoral artery. In addition, 
the  superficial  femoral  artery  Doppler  signal sounded more 
triphasic and not as obstructive.

The  patient was taken to the Intensive Care Unit in critical 
condition.

[**2544-7-15**] - [**2544-7-16**]

Pt was weaned of pressors for blood pressure control. Pt was 
also extubated. 

[**2542-7-17**] 

Seemed like pt improved, remained in sicu, extubated. Pt was 
gently diuresed with lasix.  

PT HIT panel came back negative. Hirudin was dc'd. Pt medication 
was changed back to heparin.

To note, pt remained slighty tachycardic. Pt was beta blocked.

At about 1230 pt experienced decrease sats, with an increase in 
breathing. His heart rate was in the 140's, with low BP SBP 
90's.

It was thought the pt was experiencing resp distress. He was 
given lasix. There was a low threshold for reintubation 
([**Hospital1 2999**]). His heparin was increased to 1000 units hr. Thinking 
that this could be a PE.

[**2544-7-18**]

PA catheter changed to triple lumen. Pt was transfused 1 unit 
PRBC's for decrease BP, still was tachy (140), after blood 
transfusion pt remained in sinus tach. with SBP 80 - 90. His 
levo was weaned off.

[**2544-7-19**]

Pt spiked temperature to 102, became more tachycardic with SBP 
in the 70's. Levophed was restarted. Also to note. pt had an 
increase in resp to the 30's. A stat ABG was done. 7.43 / 29 / 
71 / 120 / -3 / 95%.

CXR showed r plueral effussion.

Pt started on esnolol to decrease his HR. Lephofed was changed 
to neo and titrated for a MAP of 70.

Pt resp status continued to worsen. Pt intubated by anesthesia.

Pt developed PEA - ACLS protocol was initiated.

pt recieved several rounds of epi / bicarb / ca ( BP / HR would 
return for short periods of time. )

Right chest tube placed. two liters of transudate recoverd. F/U 
CXR showed no effussion or pnuemothorax.

Pericardial centesis performed ( 10 cc non pulsatile blood )

Cardiology consulted - echo rechecked. pericardial effussion 
with ? tamponade. Bedsidetap performed.

Pt developed and maintained PEA dispite continual ACLS 
protocols.

Pt expired. Pronounced dead.

     HISTORY: 68-year-old male presents with right cold foot. The patient is status
     post right axillary-bifemoral bypass which is now occluded as seen by duplex
     ultrasound.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: The procedure was performed by Drs. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 615**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 262**] [**Doctor Last Name 263**]
     d'Othee with the attending radiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 263**] [**Name (STitle) 264**] being present in the
     entire procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE: The risks and benefits were explained to the patient and informed
     consent was obtained. The patient was placed supine on the angiographic table
     and his left arm was prepped and draped in sterile fashion.
     Under local anesthesia using 1% lidocaine, the left brachial artery at the
     level of elbow joint was accessed using a 19 gauge needle and an 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 528**]
     wire was placed into the left subclavian artery under fluoroscopy.
     The needle was exchanged for a 4 French sheath with its sidearm connected to a
     continuous heparinized saline irrigation. A 4 French Omniflush catheter was
     placed over the wire and advanced into the abdominal aorta. Angiograms were
     performed when the tip of the catheter was at the level of L1 and just above
     the aortic bifurcation respectively. This was followed by a bilateral leg
     runoff arteriograms. At the end of the procedure the catheter and sheath were
     removed and local hemostasis was achieved by manual compresssion. The patient
     tolerated the procedure well with no complications.
     
     FINDINGS: The angiograms showed occlusion of the abdominal aorta just below
     the takeoff of the inferior mesenteric artery ([**Female First Name (un) **]). The celiac trunk,
     superior mesenteric artery and single right and double left renal arteries are
     opacified. The [**Female First Name (un) **] is prominent. There are also some lumbar arteries
     visualized giving collateral circulation.
     
     On the right, the iliac vessels and common femoral artery are not opacified.
     The superficial femoral artery and profunda femoris are reconstituted just
     below their takeoff and patent. The right popliteal artery is faintly
     opacified but appears patent up to its bifurcation in the anterior tibial
     artery and the tibioperoneal trunk, both of which are faintly opacified in
     their proximal portions.

     d'Othee with the attending radiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 263**] [**Name (STitle) 264**] being present in the
     entire procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE: The risks and benefits were explained to the patient and informed
     consent was obtained. The patient was placed supine on the angiographic table
     and his left arm was prepped and draped in sterile fashion.
     Under local anesthesia using 1% lidocaine, the left brachial artery at the
     level of elbow joint was accessed using a 19 gauge needle and an 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 528**]
     wire was placed into the left subclavian artery under fluoroscopy.
     The needle was exchanged for a 4 French sheath with its sidearm connected to a
     continuous heparinized saline irrigation. A 4 French Omniflush catheter was
     placed over the wire and advanced into the abdominal aorta. Angiograms were
     performed when the tip of the catheter was at the level of L1 and just above
     the aortic bifurcation respectively. This was followed by a bilateral leg
     runoff arteriograms. At the end of the procedure the catheter and sheath were
     removed and local hemostasis was achieved by manual compresssion. The patient
     tolerated the procedure well with no complications.
     
     FINDINGS: The angiograms showed occlusion of the abdominal aorta just below
     the takeoff of the inferior mesenteric artery ([**Female First Name (un) **]). The celiac trunk,
     superior mesenteric artery and single right and double left renal arteries are
     opacified. The [**Female First Name (un) **] is prominent. There are also some lumbar arteries
     visualized giving collateral circulation.
     
     On the right, the iliac vessels and common femoral artery are not opacified.
     The superficial femoral artery and profunda femoris are reconstituted just
     below their takeoff and patent. The right popliteal artery is faintly
     opacified but appears patent up to its bifurcation in the anterior tibial
     artery and the tibioperoneal trunk, both of which are faintly opacified in
     their proximal portions.
     
     On the left, the iliac arteries and proximal common femoral artery are not

     COMPARISON:  [**2541-4-8**].
     
     PA AND LATERAL CHEST:  There is severe cardiomegaly.  The aorta is slightly
     tortuous.  The hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is slight upper zone
     redistribution of the pulmonary vascularity.  Patchy opacities at bilateral
     lung bases are suggestive of atelectasis.  There is a moderate right-sided
     pleural effusion.  Metal clips in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen are
     suggestive of s/p cholecystectomy.  Metal clips are also seen superior to the
     right lung apex.  The osseous structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1)  Severe cardiomegaly with mild CHF.
     2)  Moderate right-sided pleural effusion.
     3)  S/P cholecystectomy and right supraclavicular surgery.
     4)  Bibasilar atelectasis.  Limited evaluation of the lung parenchyma makes
     the presence of recurrent lung tumor difficult to assess.
