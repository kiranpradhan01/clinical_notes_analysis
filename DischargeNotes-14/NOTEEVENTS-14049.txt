History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 82 yo female h/o DKA three month ago, presents with 
hyperglycemia. Over the preceeding 2-3 days, her blood sugars 
(as done at NH) were in the 300s (her baseline being in the 200s 
to occasional 300s). This AM, she received 6 units of lantus (as 
part of her usual AM regimen) and 10 units of regular at 7:30 am 
with a FS of 372. She was given 12 units of regular at 12 pm, 8 
units of regular at 1 pm, and 6 units regular at 2 pm, each time 
her BS were read as ""critically high"". Per the aides, her urine 
smelled ""fruity.""  
  
In the ED, VS on admission were: T: 98.6; HR: 80; BP: 138/70;

26 with a bicarb of 16. She was given 10 units of subcutaneous 
insulin at 5:30 pm. At 6:25 pm BS noted to be in 700s, insulin 
gtt was started at 10 units/hr. Next two blood sugars in ED were 
""critically high."" She also received 4 L of normal saline while 
in the ED.

is recommended. In the absence of prior studies, CT can be

2. Biapical pleural thickening.
3. No evidence of pneumonia.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
82 year old female with history of history of DM, dementia and 
recently treated UTI who presented with DKA and another UTI.  

1. DKA: This was thought to be secondary to a UTI, especially 
given her prior history of DKA from UTI.  She was initially 
started on an insulin drip along with IVF resuccitation.  Her 
gap closed (26 to 8) and her BS normalized.  The morning after 
admission she was started on SC heparin (Lantus in the AM with a 
HISS); this overlapped with her insulin drip for a couple hours. 
 Potassium was repleted PRN; phosphate did not require any 
repletion.  Once she began taking good PO, her IVF were 
discontinued.

2. Acidosis: The patient presented with a gap acidosis in 
addition to a respiratory acidosis (pH was 7.29; gap of 26; 
bicarb of 16; pCO2 of 37).  This was thought to be secondary to 
DKA (i.e. ketones); additionally, her lactate at presentation 
was 3.9 - this may have contributed to her gap acidosis.  The 
etiology of her respiratory acidosis was unclear, although some 
degree of mental status change with hypoventilation could have 
been present.  With treatment of her DKA, her gap closed and 
chem 7 normalized.  A repeat lacate was 1.9.  

3. UTI: This was the probable cause of her DKA.  At discharge, 
the culture had grown 10,000 to 100,000 GNR without 
differentiation.  She was started on Cipro, 500 PO BID and will 
continue this for a seven (7) day course.

4. Agitation: Initially, the patient was quite agitated (e.g. 
attempting to get out of bed and pulling at her lines).  This 
was presumed to be secondary to (a) underlying dementia 
underlying a change in environment, and (b) delerium from her 
UTI.  She was treated with reassurance and haldol PRN.  At 
discharge she was much improved.

5. Dementia: Stable.  Abilify was restarted the morning after 
admission.

6. History of HTN: Had been off anti-hypertensives since early 
July.  Her blood pressure was controlled of BP meds during her 
hospital course.

7. F/E/N:  
Nutrition: Initially, the patient was kept NPO.  The morning 
after admission, a diet was begun consistent with her diet at 
the nursing home (pureed solids and nectar thick liquids). 
Lytes: Potassium was repleted PRN; she did not require phosphate 
repletion.
IVF: Initially treated with NS (4 liters in the ED, continued in 
the ICU); once her BS fellow below 250 D5 1/2 NS was begun.  
Once her PO intake improved, IVF were discontinued altogether.

8. Access: 2 PIVS. She had no need for central access.

9. Contact: Son [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Known patient lastname **] is HCP and guardian:

     Fluoroscopic guidance was provided to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1225**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5822**] for open reduction and
     internal fixation of a right hip fracture.  No radiologists were involved in
     the procedure.  Seven fluoroscopic images from that procedure were submitted
     for interpretation.  The initial image demonstrates a localization wire placed
     over the intertrochanteric region of the right hip.  Subsequent radiographs
     demonstrate open reduction and internal fixation of an intratrochanteric
     fracture, maintained in alignment with a dynamic screw.  Known pubic rami
     fractures are better demonstrated on the preoperative radiograph.

     HISTORY:  83-year-old woman status post fall.  Evaluate for fracture.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is an intertrochanteric fracture of the left proximal femur
     with varus angulation at the fracture site.  There is a separated lesser
     trochanter fracture fragment.  Old fractures are identified of bilateral
     superior and inferior pubic rami and there is hardware seen in the right
     proximal femur, which is incompletely visualized.  The distal aspect of the
     left femur and knee show no joint effusion.  No acute fractures are seen about
     the left knee.  There is a well-corticated bony density in the medial aspect
     of the left knee joint, likely a loose body.  There is overall
     demineralization.
