                                     FINAL REPORT
     MRI OF THE CERVICAL SPINE.
     
     CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Patient with right-sided radiculopathy.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  T1, T2 and inversion recovery sagittal and gradient echo axial
     images of the cervical spine were obtained.
     
     FINDINGS:  Comparison was made of the previous MRI study of [**2594-1-7**].
     
     At the craniocervical junction mild pannus formation is seen at the atlanto-
     odontoid joint unchanged from the previous study.  At C2-3 level mild
     degenerative changes are seen.  At C3-4 and C4-5 disc degenerative change and
     mild disc bulging is seen without spinal stenosis or high grade foraminal
     compromise.  At C5-6 level, disc and uncovertebral degenerative changes are
     seen with moderate left-sided and mild right-sided foraminal narrowing.
     
     At C6-7 disc and uncovertebral degenerative changes are seen with mild-to-
     moderate left foraminal narrowing.
     
     At C7-T1 and inferiorly to T3-4 degenerative changes are seen without spinal
     stenosis.  The spinal cord shows normal signal intensities.  An approximately
     2 cm hyperintense area is seen within the left lobe of thyroid which could be
     due to a cyst or mass and clinical correlation is recommended.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Multilevel degenerative changes in the cervical region due to
     cervical spondylosis without significant interval change since the previous
     MRI study of [**2594-1-7**].  No evidence of extrinsic spinal cord compression or
     intrinsic spinal cord signal abnormalities.  Left thyroid cyst or nodule for
     which clinical correlation is recommended.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      84 year old man with progressive RLE weakness over 3 days.  Concerning for cord
      compression, but no sensory level.  Needs MRI with gad of T and L spine.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      eval for cord compression
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL INFORMATION:  History of right lower extremity weakness over three
     days.
     
     Multiplanar T1 and T2W sequences.
     
     Exam is compared to prior lumbar spine study of [**2594-1-7**].
     
     FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of cord compression.  There are hemangiomata
     within the bodies of T1, T2 and T11.  There is degenerative disease of the
     lumbar spine with disc narrowing at L3/4 and moderately high-grade lumbar
     canal stenosis at this level, attributable to generalized disc bulging
     anteriorly, ligamentous redundancy and facet overgrowth posteriorly.  This is
     unchanged from previous exam of [**2593-12-24**].  There is a small to moderate-
     sized central disc protrusion at L4/5, which is producing moderate canal
     stenosis, together with post-ligamentous redundancy and facet overgrowth,
     likewise unchanged from previous examination.  The marrow signal on the T1W
     sequences is markedly depressed consistent with history of myelodysplasia.
     This has progressed since previous examination of [**2593-12-24**].
     
     IMPRESSION:  No evidence of cord compression.  Degenerative disease of the
     lumbar spine, unchanged from previous examination, with moderately severe
     canal stenosis at L3/4.  Abnormal marrow pattern consistent with history of
     myelodysplasia.

HISTORY:  This is an 84-year-old right handed man with mild
dysplasia with thrombocytopenia formerly on steroids,
hypertension, intermittent claudication of the right calf,
idiopathic nephropathy now presents with two weeks of
symptoms culminating to progressive weakness in the right
lower extremity over the last three days.  The patient notes
he was in his usual state of health until two weeks prior to
admission when he seemed to have some tingling sensation in
the fingertips.  He was seen by his PCP and had an Magnetic
resonance scan of the cervical spine which was reportedly
unchanged from previous.  About a week prior to admission he
had the onset of paroxysms of shooting pain across his chest
from the front to the back encompassing around T4.  He
recalls four days prior to admission he was weight lifting
while working out and he had sudden musculoskeletal pain in
his lower back however, he said the pain may have been
different.  About three days prior to admission he had the
insidious onset of right lower extremity weakness.  He also
states he had some dysesthetic pain in the lower extremities
and this has worsened.  Additionally he has not been ambulate
for the last three days with the progressive weakness in his
right leg.  He needed to use his cane to ambulate.  He had no
problems with [**Name2 (NI) 11168**] or bladder.

He was admitted for further workup of his weakness.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission he is afebrile and vital
signs are stable.  His mental status was normal.  He was
alert and oriented times three.  He was appropriate, follows
commands.  Language is fluent with comprehension and
repetition backwards and forward was accurate.  Calculations
were normal.  Construction was intact.  No apraxia or
neglect.  Reading and writing were normal [**1-23**] at three
minutes.  Cranial nerves were all intact. Visual acuity was
normal.  Visual fields were full.  His extraocular movements
intact.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation.  Patient's strength and sensation was normal.
Hearing was intact and symmetric.  Palate elevation was
normal.  Should shrug was normal. Tongue was midline.

His motor strength showed normal bulk and tone with no drift
and no asterixis.  He had diffuse fasciculations with no
tone.  There is no facial weakness.  Strength in his upper
extremity is full except for his hand intrinsics is [**2-25**]
bilaterally but left greater than right.  His lower
extremities, Interphalangeal on the right was 4+, on the left
was 5-.  Hip adductors was five in the right, five on the
left.  Hip abductors was 5- on the right and 5 on the left.
Hamstring was 4+ on the right, 4 on the left.  Quads were [**3-27**]
bilaterally.  TA's were [**2-25**] on the right, [**11-27**] on the left.
Ankle everters was 4+ on the right and [**12-28**] on the left.
Ankle inverters were 4+ on the right, [**12-28**] on the left.  [**Last Name (un) **]
was [**2-25**] on the right, [**12-28**] on the left.  Extensor hallucis
longus was [**2-25**] on the right, [**12-28**] on the left.  Toe flexors
were [**2-24**] bilaterally.  His upper extremity was [**12-27**]
bilaterally.  He had no lower extremity reflexes. Toes were
downgoing.  Sensation was decreased in joint position sense
in the ankles, decreased vibration in the same distribution,
no obvious sensory level.  He did have decreased pinprick
bilateral extremities.

He was admitted with rather rapidly progressive painful
ascending, asymmetrical neuropathy with weakness.  He is
areflexic with pain and weakness and however, the asymmetry
could be consistent with Guillain-[**Location (un) **] syndrome.  The
unusual feature was diffuse fasciculations however.  We
decided to do an lumbar puncture as well as an EEG for
further evaluation of this.  His Cerebrospinal fluid protein
was 157, his glucose was 65, four white cells and 75% lymphs.
The remainder of his laboratory studies, white count was
14.5, hematocrit 27.3, platelets 157, this was after
transfusion.  His INR was 1.4, his PTT was 1.4, his
creatinine was normal.  We at this felt after the results of
his lumbar puncture is most consistent with Guillain-[**Location (un) **]
syndrome.  We started on plasmapheresis and placed a consult
to the Transfusion Service.  They were able to immediately
accommodate and plasmapheresis began on that Wednesday for a
total of five cycles, Wednesday, Friday, Monday, Wednesday,
Friday plan.

He received plasmapheresis and seemed to do better, his pain
was improving and his strength returned somewhat.  Also his
fasciculations ceased.

On [**2597-2-16**] he did have an episode of hypotension with
lightheadedness on the day prior during his phoresis however,
this responded well to normal saline bolus and he did well
after holding his Lisinopril, we changed his Atenolol to
Metoprolol 12.5 mg twice a day and watched the blood pressure
closely.  His blood pressure normalized and he had no further
problems with this.  He seemed to do well over the next days
and again received plasmapheresis.  On the 28th he was on
Morphine 3 to 4 mg q four hours for pain and also increased
his Gabapentin for his neuropathic pain.

On exam that day we noticed that he had left sided facial
droop as well as left upper facial weakness.  This was
consistent with a seventh nerve peripheral neuropathy on the
left side.  This is somewhat atypical for Guillain-[**Location (un) **]
however, it has been described in the literature.  We decided
to watch him extremely closely and perform vital capacities
to monitor his respiratory status.  He continued to do well
over the weekend with no difficulty.  He had no short of
breath and no other complaints.  Pain was responding to
Morphine and his weakness was somewhat improving.

On [**2597-2-19**] his BUN and creatinine rose to 31 and 2.0.
He was also hypersomnolent after his Morphine.  We gave 1
gram of Narcan with good improvement.  We decided to watch
him closely however, he complained of blurriness in his left
eye we were unsure if this was due to dryness from his
peripheral 7th nerve difficulty and decreased blinking.
Visual acuity was approximately 20/400 on the left however,
we decided to consult Ophthalmology and at first they felt
that this could be consistent with a optic neuritis however,
later this is not felt to be the case.  He had some
difficulty with elevating his blood pressure and had an
episode where his systolic went to the 60's and due to his
hypotension and acute renal failure we decided to admit him
to the Neurological Intensive Care Unit service for close
follow-up.  We had arranged emergent plasmapheresis that
night and used Dopamine for blood pressure support.  His
vital capacity was checked q 4 and we put him on normal
saline.

While in the Intensive Care Unit he seemed to do better, his
strength was stable and his vision improved in his left eye.
His labs remained stable and platelets on [**2597-2-20**] were 57.
His hypotension was likely dysautonomia secondary to
Guillain-[**Location (un) **] syndrome was controlled on pressors.  In the
literature there has been described acute renal failure due
to severe Guillain-[**Location (un) **] syndrome and this was the likely
etiology for this.  We continued to watch him closely in the
Intensive Care Unit, his renal ultrasound showed no evidence
of hydronephrosis.  Differential diagnosis included ATN from
decreased blood pressure verses intrinsic renal disease or
possibly from he Guillain-[**Location (un) **] syndrome.

His EMG showed consistent findings with Guillain-[**Location (un) **]
syndrome.  It did show evidence of generalized sensory, motor
polyneuropathy with moderate severity, demyelinating in
character although axonal features was present.  There was
some asymmetry to the neuropathy.  It was felt by the
neurovascular team that this presentation was most likely
consistent with Guillain-[**Location (un) **] illness however, the asymmetry
was atypical.

The basis for reaching the diagnosis at that point was the
subacute history of progressive weakness including
hypo/areflexia predominantly demyelinating polyneuropathy,
electrophysiology and an albuminocytologic dissociation of
cerebrospinal fluid.  Labile blood pressure may have in fact
reflected the involvement of autonomic fibers.  Etiology of
the renal failure did remain unclear somewhat.
Plasmapheresis did remain the ideal choice.  He was improving
on the phoresis and he continued for five total treatments.

Ophthalmology felt that all in all maybe this was due to dry
eyes and not optic neuritis and we declined to scan his brain
with imaging.  He had no problems with his respiratory status
however, he still needed pressors to help with his pressure.
We continued phoresis during his Intensive Care Unit stay and
he continued to do well.  He was able to be transferred to
the floor on [**2597-2-24**] off Nipride times 24 hours with
diminished pain.  We had some problems at first controlling
his pain since he was requiring Dilaudid and we consulted the
Pain Service.  They felt that if his pain did not improve
otherwise we could try a Fentanyl patch.  We ended up
continuing his Dilaudid and tapering him down to p.o.
Percocet and this worked well to control his pain.
Hematology service also saw the patient and he has been
followed by them for MDS and ITP in the past.  They noted a
recent downward trend of his platelets were 19 on [**2-25**]
when he was seen which was down from 20 on the 4th, down from
26 also on the 4th, 23 on the 3rd, 32 on the 2nd, 35 on
[**2597-2-21**], 39 on [**2-20**] and 57 on [**2597-2-20**] despite therapeutic
phoresis.  they felt that his ongoing anemia may be in part
due to recurrence of ITP verses medication induced as
Lisinopril has been indicative of cause of thrombocytopenia
however, the [**Doctor Last Name 11**] is not new.  They told us to check Heparin
induced thrombocytopenia antibiotics and this is pending at
the time of discharge.  They felt that it was necessary to
initiate steroids,  ITP was the most likely etiology.  They
felt we should start 1 mg per kg of Prednisone q day and
start at 60 mg p.o. q day that Sunday.  They also felt we
should use Sulfonate for gastrointestinal prophylaxis as we
should avoid PPI as he has had a history of PPI related
thrombocytopenia.

In the days prior to discharge he again did well, he
maintained stable on steroids and his strength somewhat
returned.  We continued all meds as previous and continued
checking vital capacities and these were all normal.  His
chest x-ray was done on [**2-25**] which showed mild cardiomegaly
with interstitial edema.  We gave him some Lasix with a
platelet transfusion as we wanted to repeat the lumbar
puncture again and send off further laboratory tests.  Lumbar
puncture on [**2-26**] showed 4 white cells, 64 red cells with 5
polys and 82 lymphs.  The cerebrospinal fluid protein
remained elevated at 117 and his glucose was 69.  There was
no oligoclonal banding seen.  The patient's cerebrospinal
fluid for West Nile virus as there have been some reported
cases recently involving a similar presentation of
Guillain-[**Location (un) **] caused by West Nile Virus.
He will be discharged to rehabilitation.

     INDICATION:  Fluoroscopic assistance for video oropharyngeal swallow.
     
     FINDINGS:  Fluoroscopic assistance was provided for the speech and swallowing
     service.  Note is made of a right-sided IJ catheter in place.  In swallowing
     of pudding and thin liquids, there is premature spillage of liquid into the
     vallecula.  Additionally, with swallowing of thin liquids, there is
     penetration of liquid into the vocal cord without the expected appropriate
     coughing.  This occurs prior to swallowing.  There is no frank aspiration.
     With attempts to swallow a 13 mm barium tablet, the tablet is lodged in the
     vallecula, unable to be cleared with thin liquids.  However, this clears with
     pudding.  There is no significant residual after swallowing.  There is normal
     cricopharyngeal relaxation on swallowing.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Premature spillage of pudding and thin liquids as well as
     penetration into the vocal cords prior to swallow.  No frank aspiration.
     Patient is unable to successfully swallow 13 mm barium tablet without pudding.
     
     Please see a complete report by speech and swallowing service in the note
     portion of OMR for details and recommendations.

     STUDY:  CT of the pelvis.
     
     INDICATION:  84 year old male with MGUS and CIDP.  Evaluate for presacral
     edema or adenopathy.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  CT imaging of the pelvis without contrast.  Comparison is made to
     a prior CT from [**2597-2-13**].
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS:  There is evidence of extensive fat stranding and soft-
     tissue density within the presacral space.  The urinary bladder and rectum are
     unremarkable.  There is no evidence of definite pelvic lymphadenopathy on this
     non-contrast study.  The visualized portions of large and small bowel
     demonstrate no abnormal dilatation or wall thickening.  There is evidence of
     extensive calcification within the iliac vessels and the imaged portion of the
     abdominal aorta.
     
     Bone windows show no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Presacral edema is nonspecific in etiology and could relate to
     hemorrhage or inflammatory change.  The finding is new when compared to a
     prior study of [**2597-2-13**].

     HISTORY:  Myelodysplastic syndrome with polyneuropathy, right leg weakness and
     low grade fever.  Question abscess or hematoma.  Tenderness T12.
     
     Multiplanar T1, T2 gradient echo and STIR sequences before and after
     administration of gadolinium.
     
     Exam was compared with prior study of [**2597-3-14**].
     
     FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of cord compression.  There is no evidence of
     disc space infection or epidural abscess.  There is no evidence of epidural
     mass to suggest the presence of hematoma.
     
     In the cervical region there is a broad based disc osteophyte complex at C4-5
     with mild to moderate canal stenosis and moderate foraminal stenosis.  At C5-6
     there is a small left paracentral disc protrusion slightly rotating and
     distorting the cord and producing severe left foraminal stenosis.  There is
     moderate right sided foraminal stenosis at this level.  At C6-7 there is a
     left sided process which might represent either disc protrusion or
     uncovertebral joint overgrowth producing left sided neural foraminal stenosis.
      There is a small central disc protrusion at C3-4 which touches the cord but
     does not distort it.  In comparison to the previous examination these findings
     are very similar.  There does appear to be more focal component on the prior
     study on the right side at C5-6 which might represent a focal disc protrusion
     or uncovertebral joint overgrowth.  There is no evidence of focal disc
     protrusion in the thoracic region.  There is mild endplate compression of the
     inferior endplate at what is probably L1.  Based on the appearance and
     counting from above there appears to be a transitional vertebrae at the
     lumbosacral junction and for exact determination of levels the exam should be
     compared with the patient's plain films.  In the lumbar region there also
     appears to be an endplate compression of the superior endplate of L3.  Both
     these endplate compression deformities are new compared to the previous
     examination.  There is lumbar canal stenosis which is moderately severe at
     L3-4, but is unchanged since the previous examination.  The small central disc
     protrusion at L4-5 is  unchanged.  The soft tissue infiltration of the
     presacral region noted previously is much reduced compared to the previous
     examination.

     resolution of the left lower lobe opacity;  several linear densitites
     compatible with atelectasis are seen here today. The remainder of the lung
     fields are clear. There are no pleural effusions.  The soft tissue and osseous
     structures are unremarkable. However, note that the lateral view of the
     thoracic spine is limited by overlying objects.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Subsegmental atelectasis left base.

     occipital cortex for further evaluation.
     
     TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR T2 susceptability and diffuse
     and axial images of the brain before gadolinium.  T1 axial and coronal images
     were obtained following gadolinium.  Comparison was made of the previous brain
     MRI study of [**2597-2-14**].
     
     FINDINGS: The diffusion weighted images demonstrate no evidence of restrictive
     disease to indicate an acute infarct.  Mild prominence of ventricular sulci
     indicate brain atrophy.  No evidence of territorial infarct, mass effect or
     significant subcortical white matter disease is seen.  There is no midline
     shift.  Pericervicular regions are unremarkable.  Following gadolinium
     administration, no evidence of abnormal enhancement is seen.
     
     IMPRESSION: No significant change since the previous study.  No evidence of
     acute infarct or abnormal enhancment.

Social: Family appropriately coping with cmo status and anticipating discharge to home in am.  Spoke with [**Doctor First Name 916**] at [**Location (un) 6465**] VN:A 1-[**Telephone/Fax (1) 4179**] to arrange for hospice RN to do visit in am at pt's home in [**Location (un) 6465**].

Family has arranged for 24hr care with a nursing assistant to care for him at home.  Family has hospital bed.  Will need ambulance ride arranged in am.  Scripts for ativan and morphine elixir faxed to # [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6466**] in order for hospice nurse to fill scripts and have them available at pt's home in am.  As a back up, CVS in [**Location (un) **] #[**Telephone/Fax (1) 6467**] has 1 bottle of 30cc available if hospice nurse unable to fill.  Family would need to fill the scripts themselves at this pharmacy so original prescriptions need to go home with patient upon discharge.  Our pharmacy also stated that they would fill one day's worth of the morphine if outside pharmacy is unable to fill it.  
Family needs to be called in am with any updates as well as time of departure.  Message left with son [**Name (NI) 1531**] that we would call in am and inform them of his ambulance departure as well as updates with meds once we speak with VNA.
