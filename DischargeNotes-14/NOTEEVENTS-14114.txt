Admission Chest AP:
Allowing for technique, cardiac and mediastinal contours are 
likely normal. Patchy opacity is seen in the left lower 
lobe/lingular area. The right lung appears clear. There is 
slight biapical pleural thickening. Pulmonary vasculature is 
normal. Several calcified nodes are seen in the left hilum. In 
addition, there appears to be a calcified granuloma in the right 
upper lobe. There may be a small left pleural effusion. The 
osseous structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:

1. Left lower lobe/lingular patchy consolidation.
2. Calcified nodes/granuloma suggestive of past granulomatous 
infection.
EKG NSR 78bpm, nl axis, no ST or T wave changes

[**3130-12-19**]: Chest AP
The heart is enlarged but stable. The aorta is tortuous. There 
are calcified lymph[**MD Number 285**] in the AP window and left hilum and 
there are calcified granulomas in the left mid and right upper 
lung zones. These findings, as well as an area of right apical 
thickening are stable. The lungs demonstrate no focal areas of 
consolidation. No definite pleural effusions are identified on 
the single projection.

As compared to the recent study, there is improved visualization 
of the left retrocardiac area.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
77 yo F with dementia, CHF? who presentedunresponsive at psych 
facility with hypercarbic respiratory failure.
*
1) Respiratory Failure- We thought that her respiratory failure 
was multifactorial in etiology. The patient is perhaps 
hypercarbic at baseline. Pt likely hyper carbic at base line.  
We thought that pnemonia exacerbated her possible COPD/OSA/ 
obesity hypoventilation to the point where she decompensated.  
We also found that a pannus in the upper cervical spine which 
might have contributed to the patient's apnea. (see neuro 
below).  The patient was transferred to the MICU where she was 
intubated then  weaned to pressure support and then successfully 
extubated on [**12-10**].  She was then weaned off oxygen onto room 
air.  
*
2)Pneumonia exaceCeftriaxone/azith were started on admission 
which was eventually changed to levofloxacin such that she 
completed a 10 day course.
*
3)Obstructive [**Doctor Last Name 292**] apnea: She continued to desaturate 
periodically at night for which she was started on bipap with 
good effect but the patient refused to wear the bipap mask.  She 
also underwent an inpatient [**Doctor Last Name 292**] study but this was terminated 
early secondary to her refusal to wear the bipap mask.  (An 
interpreter was present.)
*
4)Psych - Pt was originally started on her home psych meds (see 
meds on admission).  However zyprexa and depakote were stopped 
due to possible respiratory depression.  Psychiatry was 
consulted and they thought that the patient had dementia and 
resolving delerium.  Her standing haldol was discontinued and 
she was started on zyprexa prn agitation. 
*
5) Neuro - CT of the head demonstrated basal ganlia lesion and a 
pannus in the upper cervical spine.  MRI done to further 
evaluate which demonstrated: a Posterior vertebral pannus 
formation C1-C2, with compression/stenosis of the spinal cord as 
it exits the foramen magnum. There was no evidence of 
intracranial hemorrhage, or minor or major vascular territorial 
infarction. Chronic lacunar infarcts were also observed 
Neurosurg consulted.  The spoke to the pts home neurosurgeon at 
[**Hospital **] Hospital and found that this was a problem that had 
already been worked up.  Because of her poor baseline functional 
status the pt was felt to be a poor surgical candidate.  She was 
placed in a cervical collar which she refused to wear.
*
6)In light of the continued improvement in her mental status we 
(the medical team and the patient's family) thought that it 
would be best if the patient were transferred to a rehab/long 
term care center where she could prepare for the upcoming 
surgery should her family decide to procede. At this time the 
family deferred surgery in light of her condition.

     INDICATION:  Found unresponsive at rehab center with hypercarbia.  Rule out
     intracranial process, masses, focal lesions.
     
     TECHNIQUE:   Non-contrast head CT.
     
     FINDINGS: There are areas of decreased attenuation within the basal ganglia
     and adjacent white matter bilaterally, and an infarct in this region cannot be
     excluded.  There is no intra or extra-axial hemorrhage.  There is no mass
     effect or shift of normally midline structures.
     
     There is significant calcification surrounding the dens at the C1-2
     articulation with associated soft tissue density.  There is apparent
     compression of the medulla and upper cervical spinal cord at this level,
     though evaluation on this study is suboptimal.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1)  No evidence for intracranial hemorrhage.
     2)  Areas of decreased attenuation within the basal ganglia and adjacent white
     matter bilaterally.  These findings may relate to areas of infarction of
     unknown chronicity or hypoperfusion.  If clinically warranted, an MRI with
     diffusion weighted imaging could be considered.
     3)  Calcification and apparent panus formation around the dens, which may
     compress the medulla and upper cervical spinal cord.  This could be further
     evaluated with MRI of the cervical spine.
     
     These findings were relayed by telephone to the primary team caring for this
     patient.

     COMPARISON:  Semi-upright AP portable chest x-ray of [**3130-12-7**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:   Semi-upright AP portable chest x-ray.
     
     FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube remains in satisfactory position.  The tip of
     the nasogastric tube remains in the fundus.  There is marked left ventricular
     enlargement, with likely slight worsening of the upper zone redistribution of
     the pulmonary vessels.  This appearance suggests mild pulmonary edema, worse
     since the prior study.  There is persistent left lower lobe atelectasis or
     consolidation, and an adjacent left pleural effusion cannot be excluded on the
     left.  Similar bilateral peripheral nodular densities, consistent with
     granulomas, are again identified and appear unchanged.  There is no evidence
     of pleural effusion on the right, and no pneumothorax.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1)  Evidence of possible CHF with mildly worsening pulmonary edema.

     MR OF THE HEAD
     
     INDICATION:  77 year-old female found unresponsive with hypercarbia.
     Questionable cerebral vascular accident.  Rule out intracrainal hemorrhage.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1 T2, FLAIR, susceptibility, and diffusion-weighted
     imaging of the brain was performed.
     
     FINDINGS:  Sagittal T1 weighted images reveal posterior vertebral pannus
     formation at C1-C2, with prominent compression of the spinal cord as it exits
     the foramen magnum.  There is no intracranial mass lesion, hydrocephalus, or
     shift of normally midline structures.  The ventricles are normal in size and
     configuration.  Multiple areas of increased T2 signal are visualized
     bilaterally in the periventricular white matter, and in the basal ganglia,
     consistent with chronic lacunar infarcts. There are no susceptibility
     artifacts to indicate the presence of blood products there are no
     hyperintensities on diffusion weighted imaging to indicate acute infarction.
     The major vascular flow patterns are normal.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Posterior vertebral pannus formation C1-C2, with
     compression/stenosis of the spinal cord as it exits the foramen magnum.
     Correlate clinically.  No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, or minor or
     major vascular territorial infarction.  Chronic lacunar infarcts.

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      C-spine with STIR as per neurosurgery                                           
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     MR CERVICAL SPINE [**3130-12-10**].
     
     HISTORY:  Found unresponsive with myelopathy.  C1-2 pannus is seen on head
     imaging studies.
     
     The images are severely degraded by motion artifact.  Sagittal long TR, long
     TE, STIR, and short TR, short TE spin echo imaging was attempted along the
     axial gradient echo and fast spin echo imaging.  Due to the severity of
     motion artifact, the study is non-diagnostic.  It is adequate to demonstrate
     that there is pannus posterior to the odontoid.  This compresses the
     cervicomedullary junction at the C1-2 level.  Extensive degenerative disease
     from C3 through C6 also narrows the cervical canal and appears to compress the
     spinal cord.  The study is not adequate to evaluate the signal intensity of
     the spinal cord.  However, there appears to be hyperintensity at the
     cervicomedullary junction.  The study should be repeated when the patient can
     remain motionless.  This is compared to the head CT examination of [**12-8**].
     
     CONCLUSION:  Technically limited study due to motion artifact.  Pannus
     formation at C2 with compression of the cervicomedullary junction.
     Degenerative disc disease from C3 through C6 with spinal cord compression.  A
     repeat examination should be performed when the patient can remain motionless.

     slightly limited by respiratory artifact.
     
     The ET tube and NG tube have been removed since the prior exam.  The heart and

     technique, there is equivocal mild vascular congestion, but no overt CHF.
     There is a probable calcified granuloma in the right upper lobe, unchanged.
     Calcified hilar lymph nodes are also identified.  There is increased opacity
     at the left base and in the left retrocardiac region, unchanged, representing
     atelectasis/pneumonia with possible associated small effusion.  No focal areas
     of consolidation are seen on the right, and there is no definite right

     CERVICAL SPINE MRI [**3131-3-20**].
     
     INDICATION:  Cervical stenosis, follow-up assessment, planning surgery.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Sagittal T1- and T2-weighted scans of the cervical spine were
     obtained and axial gradient echo and T2-weighted images are provided.
     
     Comparison is made to the previous cervical spine MRI of [**3130-12-10**].
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     As noted on the previous exam, there is marked pannus formation at the C1
     articulation, which results in compression of the cervicomedullary junction.
     Axial images were not obtained through this area on the current exam.
     
     There is marked motion artifact on the axial images.  Spondylosis is also
     identified at the C3-4, C4-5, C5-6, and C6-7 levels.  At C3-4, C4-5 and C5-6,
     there appears to be at least moderate spinal canal narrowing.
     
     The upper-thoracic canal is normal in caliber.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Limited examination.  Again noted is cervicomedullary compression
     from pannus formation at the C1-2 articulation.  There is also cervical spinal
     stenosis at other levels, but unfortunately visualization is not improved,
     compared to the previous study.

     HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, preoperative evaluation.  Asses for suspected 
     cardiovascular disease. 
      
     SUMMARY OF THE PRELIMINARY REPORT FROM THE EXERCISE LAB: 
     Dipyridamole was infused intravenously for 4 minutes at a dose of 0.142 
     mg/kg/min.  No EKG changes or symptoms were present during the procedure. 
      
     INTERPRETATION: 
     Two minutes after the cessation of infusion, Tc-99m sestamibi was administered
     IV.  
     Image Protocol: Gated SPECT. 
     Resting perfusion images were obtained with thallium-201. 
     Tracer was injected 15 minutes prior to obtaining the resting images. 
     This study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial perfusion model. 
      
     Left ventricular cavity is normal. 
     Rest and stress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake throughout the
     myocardium. 
      
     Gated images reveal normal wall motion. 
     The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 73%.   
      
     No prior studies are available for comparison. 
      
     IMPRESSION:  1) Normal myocardial perfusion.  2) Normal left ventricular cavity
     size and function.

     AP and lateral views of the cervical spine are suboptimal due to bedside
     supine technique.  Spine is visualized only to the level of C5 in lateral
     projection.  There is posterior osseous fusion of screws in the lateral masses
     of C2, C3, C4, and C5 with posterior rods extending to the occipital level
     where there are 2 additional screws into the calvarium.  I cannot assess C1. 
     Posterior vertical skin staples and ET tube.  Lung apices clear.  This patient
     has no preoperative radiographs for comparison on PACS.

     Three radiographs of the cervical spine again demonstrate the patient to be
     status post occipitocervical fusion.  A fixation screw from the occipital
     component is seen to have migrated into the posterior and inferior soft
     tissues.  There is questionable change in configuration of the relationship
     between the inferior aspect of the left spinal rod and the inferior most
     pedicle screw.  The surgical staples seen on [**3131-5-15**] have been removed.
     
     C1 through C5 are demonstrated.  Multilevel degenerative endplate changes
