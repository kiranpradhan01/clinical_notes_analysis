Admission Date:  [**2757-7-13**]     Discharge Date:  [**2757-7-23**]

Date of Birth:   [**2721-3-6**]     Sex:  M

Service:  Blue Surgery
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 7963**] is a 36-year-old
male with a past medical history of Hodgkin's lymphoma
treated approximately 15 years ago with staging laparotomy,
splenectomy and nodal sampling followed by x-ray radiation
therapy, the subsequent diagnosis two years ago of ITP with
evidence of splenosis by CT scan, which was treated with
Prednisone IgG, and recently treated with Rituxan with good
effect.  He presented approximately one month ago with severe
abdominal pain and was diagnosed with portal vein thrombosis and
started on coumadin after being heparinized. He presented to the
Emergency Room at [**Hospital1 10**] on
[**2757-3-13**] with 2-3 day history of increasing abdominal pain on
the right side.  At this time he denies nausea, vomiting,
positive flatus and still had a bowel movement at that time.
CT scan was obtained from an outside hospital which
demonstrated a focal area of small bowel wall thickening, portal
vein thrombosis and superior mesenteric vein thrombosis.  It was
felt at that time that patient was experiencing worsening
mesenteric ischemia and was admitted for exploratory
laparotomy to assess the viability of his small bowel.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Hodgkin's lymphoma diagnosed 15
years ago.  2) ITP diagnosed two years ago treated with IgG
and Prednisone, recently treated with Rituxan approximately
one week prior to admission.  3) Portal vein thrombosis
diagnosed approximately one month ago.  4) Hypothyroidism.
5) Restless leg syndrome.  6) Anxiety.

MEDICATIONS:  Dilaudid 4 mg q 4 hours, Prevacid 30 mg q day,
Levoxyl 250 mcg q day, Mysoline 125 mg q d, Paxil 40 mg q
day, Permax .015 mg q day, Coumadin 5 mg q day.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  A [**12-30**] pack per day smoker times
approximately 15 years, denies current alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97, blood pressure 172/91,
respiratory rate 22, oxygen saturation 93% on room air.  He
is an uncomfortable white male in apparent distress.
Respiratory exam was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiac, regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2 appreciated.
Abdominal exam showed a firm abdomen with right sided
tenderness, no shake tenderness, no cough tenderness.
Extremities were warm with palpable pulses distally.  His
rectal showed normal tone, and was guaiac negative at that
time.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission the patient had a white count
of 13.1, hematocrit of 39.1, platelet count 148,000.
Electrolytes, sodium 141, potassium 3.3, BUN and creatinine
14 and 0.9, glucose 112.  At the time of admission
prothrombin time of 23.3 and INR was 2.0.  His liver function
tests were all within normal limits with albumin of 3.2.  The
CAT scan on admission from the outside hospital again showed
small bowel wall thickening, portal vein thrombosis and
superior mesenteric vein thrombosis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2757-7-13**] for
emergent exploratory laparotomy.  He was evaluated by the
general surgery service and the vascular surgery
service.  On admission the patient was begun on a Heparin drip,
IV antibiotics.  The patient was taken for a repeat CT angiogram.
This scan showed new free fluid within the abdomen with the same
focal area of small bowel showing signs of ischemia.  Given the
severe pain and clinical exam as well as CT findings, consent was
obtained to proceed with the exploratory laparotomy.  Exploratory
laparotomy was performed with the preoperative diagnosis of
ischemic bowel.  Approximately a 50 cm segment of small bowel was
found to be thickened/congested in the mid to distal ileum. It
was found that all other small and large bowel was viable .  The
patient was admitted postoperatively from the
operating room to the surgical ICU.  The patient was left
intubated following his operation, given his bowel edema and
otherwise guarded status.  Upon admission to the surgical
Intensive Care Unit the patient was noted to have laboratory
values of white count 16.3, hematocrit 33.1, platelet count
99,000.  Coags, PT 15.5, PTT 29.2, INR 1.7, BUN and
creatinine were stable as were his liver function tests.
Once admitted to the surgical ICU the patient was sedated on
Morphine and Propofol.  Systolic blood pressure was
maintained with fluid boluses and he was left intubated.  He
was admitted with an NG tube, central venous access.  His
coag values were followed q 6 hours and Heparin drip was
begun on the patient.

Overnight in the surgical ICU from [**2757-7-13**] to [**2757-7-14**] the
patient was left intubated on Morphine and Propofol drip.  It
was decided during the morning of [**2757-7-14**] to begin to wean
his sedation.   At that time it was also decided to pursue
extubation of the patient.  The patient's sedation was
weaned.  His ventilator support was weaned as well.  In the
surgical ICU on [**2757-7-14**] values drawn at midnight showed a PT
of 16.1, PTT 29.9, INR 1.8.  On the patient's Heparin drip PT
was found to increase at 4 a.m. to 12.0, PTT was found to be
39.9 and the patient's INR was 2.0.  On [**2757-7-14**] hematology
consult was obtained.  Hematology/Oncology was asked to see
the patient for management of his portal vein and splenic
vein thrombosis and his new diagnosis of superior mesenteric
vein thrombosis given his history of Hodgkin's disease and
ITP.  At that time hematology/oncology service recommended
continuation of the Heparin drip for anticoagulation.  It was
unclear at this time why the patient developed spontaneous
portal vein and splenic vein thrombosis.  At that time they
also decided to obtain the patient's outpatient records from
[**Hospital 607**] Hospital and spoke with his hematologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
At that time the patient's goal PTT should be 55, to maintain
adequate anticoagulation given his venous thrombosis.

Overnight from [**2757-7-14**] to [**2757-7-15**] the patient was extubated
and began to complain of pain at incision.  He was also
transferred from the ICU to the floor overnight between
[**2757-7-14**] to [**2757-7-15**].  On exam the morning of [**2757-7-15**] the
patient was found to be stable, good urine output, we
continued to check hematocrit q 6 hours.  It was decided at
this time to start TPN on the patient to increase his Heparin
to maintain a goal PTT of 55 to 70.  Heparin previously at
1400 units had only elevated his PTT to a value of 45.2.  The
patient was also noted to have a declining platelet count
from 88 to 66.  There is concern at this time that given the
patient's history of prior exposure to Heparin, his current
Heparin drip, the patient might be experiencing Heparin
induced thrombocytopenia.  Complicating this picture was also
the patient's history of ITP.  Hematology/Oncology was again
asked to address this issue.  At this time a Heparin induced
thrombocytopenia panel was obtained.  This was eventually
shown to be negative.  The patient continued to do well the
day of [**2757-7-15**] with continued complaints of incisional pain.
At this time the patient's Dilaudid PCA was increased to
cover his pain.  On exam the patient's abdomen was found to
be markedly distended.  The plan at the time was just to
await return of bowel function with this patient.  We
continued to check his hematocrit q 6 hours which was found
to be fairly stable throughout his hospitalization.  During
the day, however, his platelet count continued to decline to
a value in the 50's.

Overnight from [**2757-7-15**] to [**2757-7-16**] the patient was noted to
have a mild amount of delirium.  The patient spontaneously
pulled his nasogastric tube which was replaced on the floor
without difficulty.  It was felt at the time the delirium was
probably secondary to the Ativan that was being given at that
time and to hold the Ativan.  On [**2757-7-16**] laboratory values
demonstrated a platelet count of 30 with coags demonstrating
an adequate PTT of 55.  Given the concern about the patient's
possible platelet decline being due to Heparin induced
thrombocytopenia, the patient was begun on Lepirudin on
Tuesday, [**2757-7-15**] and was continued to [**2757-7-16**].  At this time
patient's PTT value of 55 was found to be adequate with a
prudent anticoagulation.  On day of [**2757-7-16**] the patient
continued to do well, his pain was better controlled with
increased PCA dose.  Dressing was removed.  The incision was
found to be dry and intact.  The patient continued with good
urine output, had a moderate amount of NG output.  The NG
tube was putting out approximately 640 cc on the 19th, 350 cc
overnight from [**7-15**] to [**2757-7-16**] after the tube was replaced.

Overnight from [**2757-7-16**] to [**2757-7-17**] the patient continued to do
well.  The patient's platelet count, however, was noted to be
declining to a value of 16 from 20 from the previous check.
The patient's PTT was also found to be declining to a value
of 49 and it was decided at this point to increase the
patient's Lepirudin dose.  Also on [**2757-7-17**] the patient's
Heparin induced thrombocytopenia came back negative and it
was decided to restart his Heparin at that time.  The
patient's NG tube continued to have a moderate amount of
output, putting out approximately 1220 cc total overnight
from [**2757-7-16**] to [**2757-7-17**].  The patient was also noted to be
coughing up a small amount of bright red blood on [**7-17**] and it
was felt at this time this was old clot and did not represent
active bleeding in this patient.  The patient's hematocrit
continued to be stable at 26.3.  On [**2757-7-17**] the patient's
negative Heparin induced thrombocytopenia panel was felt that
his platelet drop was most likely due to recurrence of his
ITP and it was decided at that time to give IVIG of 1 gm/kg
in a divided dose over approximately two days.

Overnight from [**2757-7-17**] to [**2757-7-18**] the patient continued to do
well.  He was comfortable, however, his bowel function was
slow to return.  He was still without flatus.  His pain
control continued to be with a Dilaudid PCA.  Half his dose
of IVIG was given on [**2757-7-17**] with the other half given on
[**2757-7-18**].  The patient's platelet count was found to respond
to this IVIG regimen increasing to a value of 53.  The
patient was also restarted on his Heparin drip which was
elevated to 1800 units per hour at which time was found to
have a PTT of 47.9 and it was decided at this point to
increase Heparin dose to 2000 units per hour.  On the day of
8-22 the patient continued to do well, however, his bowel
function was again found to be slow to return.  He denied
flatus over the day of [**2757-7-18**].  His NG output was noted to
be moderately decreased over the day and it was decided at
that point to discontinue his Foley catheter and continue to
try and get his Heparin to a therapeutic PTT value.

Overnight from [**2757-7-18**] to [**2757-7-19**] the patient continued to do
well, however, he was still found to be without flatus.  He
was burping with NG tube clamped.  He was having low
residuals from his NG tube, however, his abdomen was still
distended.  His platelets continued to respond well to the
IVIG treatment increasing to a value of 86 from 53 the day
before.  It was felt at that time that his low platelets were
truly consistent with ITP.  On [**2757-7-19**] the patient continued
to do well.  However, complained of increased abdominal
distention during the day.  He was having low residuals from
his clamped NG tube but it was at that time just replaced
back to continue suction.  After replacing the tube to
continuous suction approximately 200 cc of bilious fluid was
obtained.

Overnight from [**2758-7-19**] to [**2757-7-20**] the patient continued to do
well.  He was found to be more comfortable although he was
still without flatus.  The morning of [**2757-7-20**] the patient was
given a Dulcolax suppository which induced good bowel
function.  The patient had a bowel movement shortly after
insertion of the Dulcolax suppository.

Overnight from [**2757-7-20**] to [**2757-7-21**] the patient continued to do
well, continued to have bowel movements, was reporting good
flatus. It was decided on the morning of [**2757-7-21**] to
discontinue the patient's NG tube.  The patient's Heparin
dose was running at a value of 2100 units per hour, PTT was
found to be value of 52.2.  The patient was showing good
signs of bowel function and it was decided at that time to
also start the patient on a clear liquid diet.  The patient
was noted to have elevated white count to a value of 24 on
[**2757-7-21**].  It was decided at that time to change his central
line to check a clostridium difficile toxin assay.  The
patient was also started on Flagyl 500 mg tid.  The patient's
central line was changed on [**2757-7-21**].  Culture of the central
line tip was negative.  Additionally, the patient's
clostridium difficile toxin assay was negative.  Following
changing the patient's central line, chest x-ray was
obtained.  This demonstrated the new central line to be
positioned within the right atrium.  The line was withdrawn 3
cm and was used again.  Following the patient's procedure,
central line was changed.  The patient's Heparin was stopped
for approximately two hours.  Laboratory values after
changing this line demonstrated PTT of 26.3 and the patient
was restarted on his usual dose of Coumadin.  A recheck of
the patient's PTT several hours later demonstrated a value of
46.  It was decided at this time to increase the patient's
Heparin drip to a value of 2400 units per hour, rechecking
the laboratory values on the morning of [**2757-7-22**] demonstrating
PTT of 60.6.  The patient's hematocrit was again noted to be
stable.  The patient was tolerating his clear liquid diet.
On the morning of [**2757-7-22**] it was decided to advance the
patient's diet to a full liquid diet with a regular house
diet to begin that evening.  The patient continued to do
well, continued to pass flatus and bowel function was thought
to be good.  At this time the patient was started on his home
medications of Paxil and Permax.

On the evening of [**2757-7-22**] it was also decided to begin
patient back on his dose of Coumadin for consideration of
long-term anticoagulation.  The patient was given a dose of
7.5 mg of Coumadin this evening.

Overnight from [**2757-7-22**] to [**2757-7-23**] the patient continued to do
well.  He was tolerating a solid diet and it was decided at
this time to discharge the patient home on Lovenox and
Coumadin with follow-up until his Coumadin is therapeutic.
The patient is to continue taking his Lovenox.  The patient
demonstrated good bowel function.  On [**2757-7-23**] the patient's
staples were taken out and the plan was discussed with
Hematology Oncology for long-term anticoagulation in this
otherwise complex patient.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.  He was tolerating full liquid
diet, his pain control is with oral pain medications, he is
therapeutic on a Heparin drip with a PTT value of 84 this
morning.
By review of systems:
1.  From a GI standpoint the patient is status post
exploratory laparotomy with resection of 50 cm of mid to
distal ileum for mesenteric ischemia, most likely induced by
venous congestion.  The patient is currently taking a regular
diet with good bowel function.  Pathology showed no evidence of
recurrent lymphoma.

2.  Hematology:  The patient has ITP.  The patient had a low
platelet count down into the value of the teens.  This was
treated with IVIG with good response.  The patient was to
follow-up with his regular hematology oncologist as an
outpatient for consideration of Rituxan treatment.

3.  From an anticoagulation standpoint the patient was noted
to have PTT value with a slightly elevated stay into the
80's.  It was decided that the patient will need long-term
anticoagulation given his history of a portal venous splenic
vein thrombosis and superior mesenteric vein thrombosis.
This will be accomplished with Coumadin as per the hematology
oncology service who has been in touch with his regular
hematologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].  Currently the patient has just begun
on his dose of Coumadin.

The patient is to be discharged on a dose of 1 mg/kg,
approximately 120 mg of Lovenox q 12 hours to be injected
subcutaneously.  Until his Coumadin dose is therapeutic with
an INR of 2.5.  The patient is to follow-up at [**Hospital 607**]
Hospital for laboratory draws tomorrow.  The patient has a
follow-up appointment with his hematologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on
Thursday morning at approximately 7:15.

The patient's wife has demonstrated proficiency with
administering the subcutaneous Lovenox in the past.  She has
administered this to both the patient's father and the
patient.  The patient was given his first dose of Lovenox
here in the hospital.  The patient's wife demonstrated that
she was able to give the dose to the patient with the nurse
present.  It was decided at this time the patient will not
need VNA services for administration of Lovenox.  He is to
follow-up with his regular hematologist tomorrow.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Percocet 5/325 mg 1-2 tabs po q 4
hours prn pain, Colace 100 mg po bid prn constipation,
Lovenox 120 mg q 12 hours to be administered subcutaneously,
Coumadin 5 mg q day, Protonix 40 mg q day.  Patient's home
medications which he is to begin taking again include Paxil
40 mg q day, Permax .01 mg q day, Levoxyl 250 mcg q day.

FOLLOW-UP:  With Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].

     INDICATION: Known portal and splenic vein thromboses with recent acute
     abdominal pain.
     
     COMPARISON: Outside hospital abdominal CT [**2757-7-12**].
     
     TECHNIQUE: Multiple axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained after
     the administration of intravenous contrast.
     
     CONTRAST: 150 cc of Optiray were administered due to study requirement for
     fast rate of infusion.  No complications.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There is bibasilar atelectasis. There
     are no pleural effusions.  There is new ascites which is mainly perihepatic
     and extends along the right paracolic gutter. The liver and gallbladder are
     normal in appearance.  Multiple surgical clips are seen in the left upper
     quadrant and there is a small splenule adjacent to the stomach.  The left
     kidney is atrophic.  Both kidneys enhance and excrete contrast normally.  A
     filling defect is again seen within the main portal vein and extending from
     the superior mesenteric vein.  There is some adjacent stranding within the
     surrounding fat.  Multiple small vessels are seen in the porta and are
     suggestive of cavernous transformation.  The proximal small bowel fills
     normally with contrast. There is no free air within the abdomen.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Within the right lower quadrant are
     multiple dilated loops of small bowel with wall thickening.  There is
     prominent mucosal enhancement of these loops and periluminal fluid which
     tracks down into the lower pelvis.  No pneumatosis is present.  The sigmoid
     colon, rectum, prostate and bladder are normal. There is a Foley catheter
     within the bladder.
     
     The soft tissue and osseous structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1. New ascites and abnormally thickened small bowel loops in the right lower
     quadrant.  In the setting of SMV thrombosis, the findings are worrisome for
     focal small bowel ischemia.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: Known portal and splenic vein thromboses with recent acute
     abdominal pain.
     
     COMPARISON: Outside hospital abdominal CT [**2757-7-12**].
     
     TECHNIQUE: Multiple axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained after
     the administration of intravenous contrast.
     
     CONTRAST: 150 cc of Optiray were administered due to study requirement for
     fast rate of infusion.  No complications.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There is bibasilar atelectasis. There
     are no pleural effusions.  There is new ascites which is mainly perihepatic
     and extends along the right paracolic gutter. The liver and gallbladder are
     normal in appearance.  Multiple surgical clips are seen in the left upper
     quadrant and there is a small splenule adjacent to the stomach.  The left
     kidney is atrophic.  Both kidneys enhance and excrete contrast normally.  A
     filling defect is again seen within the main portal vein and extending from
     the superior mesenteric vein.  There is some adjacent stranding within the
     surrounding fat.  Multiple small vessels are seen in the porta and are
     suggestive of cavernous transformation.  The proximal small bowel fills
     normally with contrast. There is no free air within the abdomen.

     CT SCAN OF THE BRAIN, [**2757-8-4**]:
     
     INDICATION:  History given is headache with known right frontotemporal
     hemorrhage. Evaluate for progression of bleed.
     
     There are no previous studies available for comparison.
     
     Axial noncontrast CT scans of the brain were obtained.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     There is a large rounded extra-axial collection of blood along the inner table
     of the right temporal bone, indenting and displacing the right temporal lobe.
     In its greatest width, the hemorrhage extends roughly 2.3 cm into the middle
     cranial fossa.  There is a hematocrit level within this large loculated
     component.  There is also subdural blood inferior and posterior to the right
     temporal lobe.  The uncus is medially displaced.  The suprasellar cistern is
     slightly narrowed but preserved.  The temporal [**Doctor Last Name 67**] of the right lateral
     ventricle is compressed.  There is anterior displacement of the inferior
     sylvian fissure and associated vessels as well.
     
     Brain parenchymal attenuation appears normal.  [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter
     differentiation is preserved.  The left lateral ventricle is not dilated.  The
     third ventricle is flattened and slightly bowed to the left.  Posterior fossa
     structures appear normal.
     
     No skull fractures or calvarial abnormalities are detected.  The skull base
     appears normal.
     
     There is mild ethmoid sinus mucosal thickening.
     
     IMPRESSION:  There is a large right extra-axial hemorrhage, primarily
     extending into the middle cranial fossa and medially displacing the temporal
     lobes.  There is clearly a subdural component and there may be an epidural
     component to the hemorrhage as well.

     CT SCAN OF THE BRAIN, [**2757-8-4**]:
     
     INDICATION:  History given is headache with known right frontotemporal
     hemorrhage. Evaluate for progression of bleed.
     
     There are no previous studies available for comparison.
     
     Axial noncontrast CT scans of the brain were obtained.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     There is a large rounded extra-axial collection of blood along the inner table
     of the right temporal bone, indenting and displacing the right temporal lobe.
     In its greatest width, the hemorrhage extends roughly 2.3 cm into the middle
     cranial fossa.  There is a hematocrit level within this large loculated
     component.  There is also subdural blood inferior and posterior to the right
     temporal lobe.  The uncus is medially displaced.  The suprasellar cistern is
     slightly narrowed but preserved.  The temporal [**Doctor Last Name 67**] of the right lateral
     ventricle is compressed.  There is anterior displacement of the inferior
     sylvian fissure and associated vessels as well.
     
     Brain parenchymal attenuation appears normal.  [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter
     differentiation is preserved.  The left lateral ventricle is not dilated.  The
     third ventricle is flattened and slightly bowed to the left.  Posterior fossa

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  History of ischemic bowel, SMA and portal vein thrombosis.  New
     abdominal pain.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained before and
     after the administration of 150 cc of Optiray per fast bolus technique.
     
     Comparison with prior study from [**2757-7-13**].
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:  There are bibasilar dependent
     atelectases right side greater than left.  There are linear opacities in the
     lung bases related to discoid atelectasis.  The heart is normal in size. There
     are no focal liver lesions.  The portal vein is not visualized.  The
     appearance is unchanged compared to the prior study.  The gallbladder is
     collapsed.  The pancreas is normal.  There are clips in the left upper
     quadrant.  There are several splenules.  The adrenals are normal.  Again seen
     is asymmetry of the kidney size right greater than left and stable compared to
     the prior study.
     
     There are a few dilated loops of small bowel in the right lower quadrant with
     air-fluid levels.  These loops of bowel appear matted and there is
     irregularity of the wall.  Compared to the prior study the wall edema in these
     loops of bowel has improved in the interval.  There is a small amount of fluid
     in the mesentery and mild stranding.  There has been interval resorption of
     the ascites.  The colon is unremarkable.  There is normal flow in the aorta,
     celiac, superior mesenteric and inferior mesenteric arteries.  The superior
     mesenteric vein is not well seen.  There are a few nonpathologically enlarged
     mesenteric lymph nodes.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:  The bladder and distal ureters
     are normal.  There is no pelvic fluid.  The prostate is unremarkable.  There
     is contrast in the colon.  There are a few diverticula, no evidence of
     inflammatory changes.  The bones are unremarkable.
     
     Coronal reformations demonstrate normal flow in the celiac, superior
     mesenteric and inferior mesenteric arteries.  Advance 3D reformations are not
     available and an addendum will be added when these are performed.

     collapsed.  The pancreas is normal.  There are clips in the left upper
     quadrant.  There are several splenules.  The adrenals are normal.  Again seen
     is asymmetry of the kidney size right greater than left and stable compared to
     the prior study.
     
     There are a few dilated loops of small bowel in the right lower quadrant with
     air-fluid levels.  These loops of bowel appear matted and there is
     irregularity of the wall.  Compared to the prior study the wall edema in these
     loops of bowel has improved in the interval.  There is a small amount of fluid
     in the mesentery and mild stranding.  There has been interval resorption of
     the ascites.  The colon is unremarkable.  There is normal flow in the aorta,
     celiac, superior mesenteric and inferior mesenteric arteries.  The superior
     mesenteric vein is not well seen.  There are a few nonpathologically enlarged
     mesenteric lymph nodes.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:  The bladder and distal ureters
     are normal.  There is no pelvic fluid.  The prostate is unremarkable.  There
     is contrast in the colon.  There are a few diverticula, no evidence of
     inflammatory changes.  The bones are unremarkable.
     
     Coronal reformations demonstrate normal flow in the celiac, superior
     mesenteric and inferior mesenteric arteries.  Advance 3D reformations are not
     available and an addendum will be added when these are performed.

     IMPRESSION:  1.  Evolution of acute-to-chronic stasis/ischemia in the small
     bowel, persistent stranding and fluid in the mesentery.  No evidence of bowel
     obstruction since the air-fluid levels are limited to the abnormal loops of
     bowel in the right lower quadrant.
     
     2.  Nonvisualization of the portal vein and superior mesenteric vein
     consistent with known diagnosis of portal vein thrombosis.  The findings are
     unchanged in the interval.  Findings were discussed with clinical team at the
     time of the exam.

     HISTORY:  FMD and portal vein thrombosis, mesenteric ischemia, postop Day 8
     after lysis of adhesions and resection of 10 cm of small bowel.  Elevated
     white count.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained after
     administration of 150 cc Optiray per patient's request.
     
     COMPARISON with prior study from [**2757-9-3**].
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  There are linear opacities in the lung bases
     consistent with subsegmental atelectases.  There are small bilateral pleural
     effusions.  There are small bibasilar areas of consolidation.
     
     There are no focal liver lesions. The gallbladder is partially distended.  The
     portal vein is not seen, consistent with known history of portal vein
     thrombosis.  The superior mesenteric vein is not enhancing; it appears
     slightly enlarged, also consistent with known history of superior mesenteric
     vein thrombosis.  The pancreas is unremarkable.  There is no intra or
     extrahepatic ductal dilatation.  There are clips in the splenic fossa.  Again
     seen are small splenules, which are unchanged.  Both adrenal glands appear
     slightly enlarged when compared to the prior study. The left one measures 5.3
     x 2 cm.  Again seen is asymmetry in the size of the right kidney when compared
     to the left, unchanged compared to the prior study.  There is symmetric
     excretion; the ureters are not dilated.  Loops of small bowel are not dilated.
     Contrast is seen in the right hemicolon.
     
     There is a fluid collection in the midline of the anterior abdominal cavity,
     which extends along the site of the midline incision. The collection has rim
     enhancing borders and a few air droplets in the more inferior portion, as well
     as a few air droplets in the more superior portion.  The greatest measurement
     is 10.5 x 2.4 cm.  Inferiorly this collection also extends in the right
     anterior abdominal cavity, anterior to the right ascending colon. A smaller
     collection is seen posterior to the previously described collection, adjacent
     to a loop of small bowel; it measures 3.2 x 4.8 cm.  It does not seem to
     communicate with the larger collection.  There is a small amount of fluid
     within the mesentery in the lower abdominal cuts.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The bladder and both ureters are normal.  The
                                                                 (Over)

     rectum is decompressed. The prostate is unremarkable.  The bones are
     unremarkable.
     
     Coronal reformations were obtained and confirm the presence of a
     multiloculated interloop collection, the largest component measuring 13 x 7.7
     cm in the coronal plane.  The more inferior component may not be connected to
     this larger collection and it measures 3.8 x 7.7 cm.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1. New collection in the anterior abdominal cavity, adjacent to loops of small
     bowel.   The largest collection is amenable to CT or ultrasound guidance.
     
     2. No change in portal and superior mesenteric vein thrombosis.

        36 year old man with s/p lysis of adhesions and small bowel resection         
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      please complete CT or U/S guided drain placement and culture for anterior 
      abdominal abscess. Pt s/p lysis of adhesions and small bowel resection.
     No contraindications for IV contrast

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  S/P lysis of adhesions and small bowel resection, evaluate for
     anterior peritoneal abscess.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  CT guidance for drainage, CT localization for needle placement, CT
     guided aspiration of two collections.
     
     CT GUIDANCE FOR DRAINAGE:  A grid was placed in the anterior abdomen and the
     patient was scanned without IV contrast in the mid abdomen.  Again seen is a
     collection in the anterior abdominal cavity, anterior to loops of small bowel.
     A second collection was seen in the inferior peritoneal cavity, at
     approximately the level of the iliac crest.
     
     CT GUIDANCE FOR NEEDLE LOCALIZATION:  The patient signed the consent after
     full explanation of risks and benefits.  Using sterile technique, CT
     fluoroscopic guidance  and Lidocaine as local anesthesia, a 20 g. needle was
     introduced in the upper abdominal collection, approximately at the level of
     the right mid kidney.
     
     A second needle was placed in an anterior peritoneal collection located in the
     inferior abdominal cavity, at approximately the level of the iliac crest also
     using CT fluoroscopic guidance. 
     
     CT GUIDED ASPIRATION OF TWO COLLECTIONS:  Approximately 1.5 cc of
     serosanguineous fluid were aspirated from each collection and samples were
     sent for culture.  The collections were not completely drained due to
     viscosity of the fluid and size of the needle.  There were no immediate
     complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Samples were obtained from a superior anterior peritoneal
     collection and also from an inferior anterior peritoneal collection, fluid was
     sent to the Lab for cultures.  The fluid is compatible with a resolving
     hematoma and if there is further need for a drainage the procedure can be
     guided by CT . At the present time the patient still has oral contrast in the
     stomach and conscious sedation cannot be administered . Findings were
     discussed with clinical team.

     HISTORY:  FMD and portal vein thrombosis, mesenteric ischemia, postop Day 8
     after lysis of adhesions and resection of 10 cm of small bowel.  Elevated
     white count.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained after
     administration of 150 cc Optiray per patient's request.
     
     COMPARISON with prior study from [**2757-9-3**].
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  There are linear opacities in the lung bases
     consistent with subsegmental atelectases.  There are small bilateral pleural
     effusions.  There are small bibasilar areas of consolidation.
     
     There are no focal liver lesions. The gallbladder is partially distended.  The
     portal vein is not seen, consistent with known history of portal vein
     thrombosis.  The superior mesenteric vein is not enhancing; it appears
     slightly enlarged, also consistent with known history of superior mesenteric
     vein thrombosis.  The pancreas is unremarkable.  There is no intra or
     extrahepatic ductal dilatation.  There are clips in the splenic fossa.  Again
     seen are small splenules, which are unchanged.  Both adrenal glands appear
     slightly enlarged when compared to the prior study. The left one measures 5.3
     x 2 cm.  Again seen is asymmetry in the size of the right kidney when compared
     to the left, unchanged compared to the prior study.  There is symmetric
     excretion; the ureters are not dilated.  Loops of small bowel are not dilated.
     Contrast is seen in the right hemicolon.
     
     There is a fluid collection in the midline of the anterior abdominal cavity,
     which extends along the site of the midline incision. The collection has rim
     enhancing borders and a few air droplets in the more inferior portion, as well
     as a few air droplets in the more superior portion.  The greatest measurement
     is 10.5 x 2.4 cm.  Inferiorly this collection also extends in the right
     anterior abdominal cavity, anterior to the right ascending colon. A smaller
     collection is seen posterior to the previously described collection, adjacent
     to a loop of small bowel; it measures 3.2 x 4.8 cm.  It does not seem to
     communicate with the larger collection.  There is a small amount of fluid
     within the mesentery in the lower abdominal cuts.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The bladder and both ureters are normal.  The
                                                                 (Over)

     excretion; the ureters are not dilated.  Loops of small bowel are not dilated.
     Contrast is seen in the right hemicolon.
     
     There is a fluid collection in the midline of the anterior abdominal cavity,
     which extends along the site of the midline incision. The collection has rim
     enhancing borders and a few air droplets in the more inferior portion, as well
     as a few air droplets in the more superior portion.  The greatest measurement
     is 10.5 x 2.4 cm.  Inferiorly this collection also extends in the right
     anterior abdominal cavity, anterior to the right ascending colon. A smaller
     collection is seen posterior to the previously described collection, adjacent
     to a loop of small bowel; it measures 3.2 x 4.8 cm.  It does not seem to
     communicate with the larger collection.  There is a small amount of fluid
     within the mesentery in the lower abdominal cuts.

     HISTORY:  36 year old man with portal vein thrombosis, history of bowel
     ischemia, presents with severe abdominal pain.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained before and
     after the administration of IV contrast.  Comparison with prior multiple
     studies from August and [**2757-8-27**]. 
     
     There are bibasilar dependent atelectases.  There is a small amount of right
     pleural fluid.  There has been interval resolution of the left small pleural
     effusion.  Multiple clips are seen in the left upper quadrant and the anterior
     abdomen.
     
     There are no focal liver lesions.  Again seen is cavernous transformation of
     the portal vein.  There is a collateral vessel adjacent to the gallbladder.
     The gallbladder is partially distended and unremarkable.  The pancreas, left
     adrenal and right kidney are normal.  Again seen is a small left kidney which
     is unchanged in the interval.  There is a small amount of fluid adjacent to
     the right adrenal gland.  The superior mesenteric vein is not clearly
     identified in the present study.  Normal flow is seen in the celiac, superior
     mesenteric and inferior mesenteric arteries.  There are no enlarged
     retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
     
     The stomach is distended with fluid.  The duodenum and small portion of the
     jejunum are not dilated.  There is a long segment of mid-jejunum which is
     dilated measuring up to 4 cm in greatest dimension.  There are air-fluid
     levels within the dilated loops of small bowel, no evidence of pneumatosis.
     There is a small amount of fluid in the mesentery adjacent to the dilated
     loops of small bowel.  There are nondilated loops of small bowel in the ileum.
     There is no evidence of free air in the abdomen.  Again seen are multiple
     surgical sutures in the small bowel.  There is mild stranding of the mesentery
     inferior to the dilated loops of bowel.  The colon is unremarkable.  Again
     seen are multiple small splenules.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is a Foley catheter within the
     bladder.  There is a tiny amount of pelvic fluid.  The prostate is
     unremarkable.  The bones are normal.
