Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2662**] 
Chief Complaint:
Transfer for junctional bradycardia, history of Chest pain
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization
 
History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old female with h/o CAD, PAF who was in her USOH until 2 
weeks PTA when she experienced an episode of chest pain, for 
which she presented to [**Hospital 10248**] Hospital and was noted to be in 
AF. She was started on amiodarone/digoxin and d/ced home.  She 
was doing well at home until [**2936-12-11**] (2 days ago) when she 
re-presented to [**Hospital3 **] following an episode of chest 
pain. She reports that she awoke at 6 a.m. with dull/heavy 
central chest pain, non-radiating, associated with coughing/mild 
shortness of breath and LH. No associated N/V, diaphoresis. She 
took one SLNTG with some improvement. EMS gave her an ASA and 
another SLNTG. In the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 493**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], she received 1 inch of NTP with 
complete resolution of symptoms. EKG showed nonspecific STTW 
abnormalities and she was admitted for further management. 
Cardiac enzymes were cycled with max TnI 0.5 (upper limit of 
normal 0.4). Given INR was 3, she was not started on heparin 
gtt. Today, HCT 25.9 (from 28) and she was transfused 1uPRBC. On 
[**12-12**], she became LH and mildly nauseas, no chest pain/pressure, 
she was noted to be in a junctional rhythm, HR 45, bp 114/68 and 
she was transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for further management.  Her 
amiodarone, digoxin, cardizem were held upon transfer and on 
presentation to ED she had reverted back to NSR with HR in the 
60's.  She was CP free on arrival with resolution of her 
symptoms of LH, nausea. 
Of note, she reports that besides the similar episode of chest 
pain 2 weeks ago, She reports that she has had intermittent 
chest pain for the last 2-3 months, occurring 3-5 times a week 
when walking [**1-22**] block, or walking around her house.  These 
episodes of chest pain are relieved with rest. She denies LE 
edema or PND. She sleeps on 2 pillows a night, due to back 
discomfort rather than true orthopnea.
.
Currently, she denies chest pain, nausea/vomiting, 
lightheadedness, diaphoresis.
.
ROS: No fever, headache, rhinorrhea, sore throat, cough, sputum 
production, hemoptysis, abdominal pain, diarrhea/constipation 
(last BM yesterday). No BRBPR, although she notes that her stool 
has been dark since starting iron. (+) occasional chills and 
decreased appetite since being started on amiodarone and dig.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to [**Hospital1 19**] after developing junctional rhythm at 
OSH. By the time she got here, she was in NSR.  The first part 
of her hospitalization involved close blood pressure control, 
management of her mild CHF, evaluation of her anemia, evaluation 
for an elevated WBC count(resolved), and evaluation/treatment of 
her intermittment chest pain.  As the pain was felt to be a 
direct result of coronary disease, the patient was taken to 
cardiac catheterization.  She had three vessel disease. A stent 
was placed in the left circumflex artery and soon afterwards, 
she became less responsive, hemiparetic, and aphasic.  She was 
evaluated by the acute stroke team immediately and felt to have 
an embolic occlusion of the left MCA.
A CT scan showed no evidence of bleeding.  A extensive 
discussion was held among the stroke team, interventional 
radiology, cardiology, and her sister and brother (available by 
phone).  The family wanted to proceed with thrombolysis.  Both 
IV and IA approaches were discussed.  However, since the patient 
had received a direct thrombin inhibitor during the 
catheterization, it was felt that IV t-[**MD Number 10249**] pose a high risk 
of bleeding.  The risks and benefits of IA t-PA were extensively 
discussed with the family and they wanted to proceed with IA-tPA 
and gave consent.  Angiography revealed an M1 occlusion which 
did not open after t-PA was delivered to the thrombus.  She 
tolerated the procedure well and had no complications from the 
procedure. Repeat CT scan showed the question of a small amount 
of petechial bleeding versus contrast.  After transfer to the 
ICU, she had to be intubated for respiratory distress and 
continued to do poorly.  An EEG ruled out seizure.  She did not 
wake up despite being off all sedating medications.  Her vital 
signs remained fairly stable, but she was not overbreathing the 
ventilator. A repeat CT scan showed that she had infarcted the 
entire distribution of the MCA.  She continued to be 
unresponsive and a family meeting was held.  They decided to 
consider making her CMO as her outlook was very poor.  On the 
next day, she had pupillary asymmetry and a repeat scan showed 
increased edema with significant midline shift and herniation.  
At this time, her family decided to make her CMO. SHe was 
extubated and expired several hours later.

     INDICATION:  [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman with new right-sided weakness status post
     cardiac catheterization.
     
     COMPARISONS:  None.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is no intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage.  There is no mass
     effect, hydrocephalus, or shift of the normally midline structures.  The
     ventricles, cisterns, and sulci are unremarkable, without effacement.  The
     [**Doctor Last Name 63**]-white matter differentiation appears preserved.  Bilaterally in the
     cerebral hemispheres, there are regions of hypodensity in the white matter
     consistent with prior small vessel ischemic infarcts, including a more well-
     defined round focus in the left parietal lobe of 5 mm in diameter.  A region
     of encephalomalacia in the left middle cerebral artery distribution, which
     extends to the cortex, is probably related to prior infarction.  Other than
     some thickening in the nasal mucosa, the surrounding osseous structures, soft
     tissues and paranasal sinuses are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  No evidence of acute infarction or intracranial hemorrhage.  However, for
     acute ischemia, an MR would be more sensitive for evaluation.
     2.  Findings suggestive of chronic small vessel ischemic infarcts, as well as
     a region of encephalomalacia in the left middle cerebral artery territory.

     COMPARISONS:  CT from earlier on the same day.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast head CT.
     
     FINDINGS:  Presumably because of recent cerebral angiogram, there has been
     considerable persistent contrast enhancement of the intracranial vessels.
     There is no significant mass effect, hydrocephalus or shift of the midline

     cerebral artery territory, the [**Doctor Last Name 63**]-white differentation is preserved.
     
     There is new hyperdensity in the basal ganglia, as well as along the left
     frontal cortex within the sulci. In the setting of recent contrast
     administration, this appearance could represent petechial hemorrhage within
     the region of infarction or persistent contrast enhancement. However, there is
     no organized hematoma. Otherwise there has been no significant interval
     change.
     
     IMPRESSION:

     CLINICAL HISTORY:
     
     Patient presented with acute stroke s/p cardiac catheterization. Suspicion of
     occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery.
     
     The patient is here for intra-arterial thrombolysis. 
     
     Informed consent was obtained from the family and after explaining the risks
     indications and alternative management.  
     
     The family proceeded with intra-arterial thrombolysis.
     
     Neurology was involved in this procedure and they recommended intra-arterial
     thrombolysis.  
     
     TECHNIQUE:
     
     The patient was brought to the Neurointerventional Suite and placed on the
     table in supine position.  Access to the right common femoral artery was
     obtained via 19 gauge needle under aseptic precautions under local anesthesia.
     
     Anesthesia team  was present in the room during the procedure.
     
     A 6-French catheter system was administered.  MPD catheter was introduced and
     the left common carotid artery was selectively catheterized.  An arteriogram
     was performed which demonstrated total occlusion of the left middle cerebral
     artery branch at M1 segment.  Based on the diagnostic findings, it was decided
     that the patient would benefit from and was a good candidate for thrombolysis.
     
     At this point a microcatheter was begun.  A microcatheter using a microwire
     was introduced into the left middle cerebral artery branches.  Intra-arterial
     TP was administered.  Please refer to the nursing notes for accurate dosage.
     This dose was administered over a period of 30 minutes.  There was minimal
     improvement in the flow noted in the left middle cerebral artery branches.

Recieved in NSICU-A s/p TPA to CM1 in interventional radiology. Pt taken to CT from IR for change in neurostatus. Small bleed at TPA site per Nerosurg team most likely from reperfusion and should be self limiting. On arrival pt was opening eyes to sternal rub, moving left arm purposefully and both legs on bed. Right arm does not move to deep pain. Perrl/brisk/3mm. Sonorous breathing noted, pt vomited approximately 50cc green bile. Desision made with ICU team and family at that time to intubate pt for airway protection. Family agrees and also wishes all measures to be taken at this time to see how pt does over the next several days. Intubation uneventful, bilateral breath sounds noted. Left lung fields decreased later in shift accompanied by drop in 02 sat. Ett in to far as noted on CXR by SICU resident and pulled back to 22cm at lip with 02 sat back up to 98% and breath sounds on left side improved. Propofol gtt initiated for pt comfort while intubated, rate now at 30mcg/kg/min. Pt also suctioned for scant bile stained sputum.  Pls see abg/vent setting per careview. Labetelol gtt ordered and hung to keep sbp<160, currently off for bradycardia and sbp 120's/40's. Pt with hx of medication induced bradycardia- cardiology to talk with team re: changing to nitrates for bp control. Foley catheter in place draining 40cc+ clear urine hourly. GI: Abd obese, bs not apprecatied. To hold on OGT or any other invasive equipment for 24hrs post TPA. Pt on oral hypoglycemic agents at home, lates glucose 285 covered per sliding scale insulin. Skin surfaces intact, pedal pulses present. Will continue full support and keep family up to date. All else as above.

     for interval change.
     
     COMPARISON:  Study from [**2936-12-18**] at 16:27.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT.
     
     CT HEAD WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is a large area of decreased attenuation
     within the left MCA distribution consistent with evolving infarct.
     Additionally, there is high density material within this area. There is also
     sulcal effacement.  There is no shift of normally midline structures. The
     frontal and occipital horns of the left lateral ventricle are widely patent.
     Again seen is decreased attenuation in the periventricular white matter
     consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic infarct.  Soft tissue and
     osseous structures are stable in appearance.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Large area of decreased attenuation within the left MCA
     distribution consistent with an evolving infarct.  Additionally, there are
     areas of hyperdensity within the infarct of uncertain etiology. May represent
     normal hyperperfused cortex vs subtle hemorrhage. A follow up CT may be
     performed in 6-12 hours for further evaluation.

     Reason: progression, herniation                                     
     Admitting Diagnosis: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE;CHEST PAIN
     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with L MCA CVA now new neurologic changes                     
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      progression, herniation                                                         
     No contraindications for IV contrast
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Left middle cerebral artery infarction, new neurologic changes.
     
     COMPARISON:  Non-contrast head CT from [**2936-12-19**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT.
     
     FINDINGS:  Again seen is a large area of decreased attenuation in the left
     middle cerebral artery distribution, consistent with an evolving infarct.  On
     today's scan, there is 22 mm of rightward subfalcine herniation, new since the
     prior study.  There is contralateral obstructive hydrocephalus.  The
     previously seen areas of hyperdensity within the area of infarct are not well
     demonstrated on this study.  No new areas of intraparenchymal or extraaxial
     hemorrhage are identified.  No fractures are identified.  The opacification of
     the paranasal sinuses likely relates to intubation.
     
     IMPRESSION:  New development of large subfalcine herniation with contralateral
     hydrocephalus due to the infarct.
     
     These findings were emergently conveyed to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7027**] at 11:30 a.m. on
     [**2936-12-20**].
