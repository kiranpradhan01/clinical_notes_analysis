History of Present Illness:
HPI: [**Age over 90 **] y/o F with PMHx of bronchiectasis was transferred from 
[**Hospital **] Rehab for change in mental status, fever, and respiratory 
distress.  
.  
The patient arrived to the ER at 4:50 PM [**Hospital 10166**] [**Hospital **] Rehab. She 
was febrile to 103.6, tachycardic to 105, tachypenic at 38, and 
was 98% on NRB, bp 106/41. She was not answering questions. Labs 
revelaed K of 5.7, Na of 150, WBC of 30. CXR showed LLL PNA. She 
received ceftriaxone 2g IV, azithromycin 500 mg IV, Vancomycin 1 
g, Tylenol 1 g PR, insulin 5u/d50 1 amp, Kayexelate 15 g PR and 
was sent to 11R around 10PM to be admitted to nightfloat. The 
son called 11R to speak with the NF residet. At that time, the 
NF resident I was called to see the patient at 10:45PM by the NF 
resident for concern of obtundation and tachypnea. At that time, 
the patient's ABG was 7.08/109/144. A respiratory code was 
called and the patient was intubated. When the ETT was placed, 
it initially filled with yellow-tinged sputum which was 
copisously suctioned. She was transferrred to the FICU.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: please eval for infiltrate,PTX, CHF 

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
[**Age over 90 **] year old woman with fever, tachypnea 
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please eval for infiltrate,PTX, CHF 
INDICATION: Fever, tachypnea.

COMPARISONS: [**3091-11-18**].

SINGLE VIEW CHEST, AP: There is a consolidation involving the 
left lower lobe with patchy airspace opacities also involving 
the left mid lung zone. Dense calcification of the aorta is 
again identified. The right lung is essentially clear. A likely 
left-sided pleural effusion is also present. An old left humeral 
head fracture appears stable.

IMPRESSION: Left lower lobe pneumonia.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
In the FICU, she became hypotensive. Levophed was begun. Vent 
settings were changed after her first gas intubated was 
7.21/68/285. Her CVP as 4 and she was given 5L NS and 1 unit [**12-13**] 
NS once Na was back. R IJ and R art line was placed. Labs were 
drawn which showed hypocalcemia, hypernatremia, and 
normokalemia. At 3:43 AM, she went into an atrial tachycardia 
with a rate of 160's with her pressure dropping into the 40's. 
Code was initiated. She was cardioverted into sinus rhythm with 
200J and blood pressure resumed. Vasopression was started with 
the attempt to quickly wean off the levophed. She had very 
labile BP in next 1 hour ranging anywhere from 80 on max vaso 
and levo to 180 off both. She again entered into an atrial 
tachycardia and I cardioverted her with 100J into sinus rhythm 
again. During this time, the intern called the grandson again 
and reiterated her poor prognosis. The grandson decided to make 
the goals of care comfort. Pressors were stopped and the patietn 
was placed on a T-piece.

     AP chest radiograph shows interval placement of an endotracheal tube in
     satisfactory position since prior study of [**3097-12-23**]. Again seen are
     bilateral interstitial opacities consistent with edema.  Left lower lobe
     opacity appears stable consistent with atelectasis, effusion, or possibly
     consolidation.  There has been some mild interval improvement of the left mid
     lung opacities, suggesting this was likely secondary to edema or possibly
     aspiration.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Satisfactory position of endotracheal tube.  Edema consistent
     with fluid overload/CHF.  Stable left lower lobe opacity, pneumonia cannot be
     excluded.

     INDICATION:  Fever, tachypnea, respiratory arrest, now with line placement.
     
     In comparison to AP chest radiograph performed two hours earlier, there has
     been interval placement of a right-sided central line with the tip overlying
     the SVC/right atrial junction.  Nasogastric tube is seen overlying the stomach
     with the tip beyond the edge of the film.  Endotracheal tube is again seen in
     satisfactory position.  Again seen are bilateral interstitial opacities
     consistent with edema and left lower lobe opacity, unchanged from prior study.
     Better seen on this film is an opacity in the left lung apex, likely
     representing costal cartilage seen on os.  There is also evidence of old left
     humeral head fracture.
     
     IMPRESSION:  New right-sided central line with tip overlying the SVC atrial
     junction.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  Stable-appearing edema and left lower
     lobe opacity.
