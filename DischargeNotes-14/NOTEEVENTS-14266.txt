Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6704**] 
Chief Complaint:
transfered from OSH for medical management of AMI and other 
multiple medical problems. 
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
right knee incision and drainage (bursa washout)
 
History of Present Illness:
Patient is a poor historian. The following history is taken from 
the notes and from the patient.  
.  
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 526**] is a 73 yo M who is transferred from an OSH s/p fall 
at home. He was brought by EMS to the OSH. He was found awake 
and alert but on the ground complaining of weakness and fatigue. 
Per patient, he just couldn't get up. No LOC or hitting his 
head. No loss of bowel or bladder function. He was brought to 
the OSH and was found to have an elevated WBC, Cr 4.8, and 
slightly elevated troponin I on admission. Subsequent troponins 
continued to rise with a max of 4.7 and he was started on a 
heparin gtt. He was also found to be fluid overloaded and with 
ascities. He received a paracentesis with removal of 5L and 
dialysis (per his home schedule on T, TH, Sa). During the course 
of his hospitalization, he developed what was thought to be a 
gout flare in his right knee. He has received most of his 
medical care at [**Hospital1 19**] in the past and was transferred here for 
further medical management.  
.  
On ROS he denies current SOB, CP, n/v, f/c, diarrhea. He makes 
very little urine on his own. He describes pain in his right 
knee which has improved slightly from yesterday. He denies any 
current lightheadedness, HA, changes in vision, cough, 
palpitations, or abdominal pain.

Pertinent Results:
Labs on transfer from OSH: WBC 6.9 with 93.5%PMNs, 22% bands, 
6%metamyelocytes, 1 nucleated RBC, Hgb 12.7, Plts 101, PTT 67 on 
heparin gtt of 600 units, sodium 134, potassium 4, chloride 99,

Studies from OSH:  
[**2770-1-5**]: CXR 2 views: no pneumonia. Cardiomegaly. Pacemaker 
inplace. no evidence of CHF. Small pleural effusion on lateral 
view.  
.  
[**2770-1-6**]: U/S guided paracentesis: removal of 5100 mL fluid with 
270 WBC, with 14%PMNs, 24% L, 60% monocytes, 10,000 RBC  
.  
[**2770-1-6**] VQ scan: low probability of PE  
.  
ECHO (per d/c summary from OSH- no actually report with transfer 
papers) showed poor LV function with an EF of 30-35%.  

Labs from [**Hospital1 19**]:

Micro:  staph aurea from prepatellar bursa x3
 
Brief Hospital Course:
70 yo M with multiple medical problems including RV dysplasia 
leading to right heart failure and chronic hepatic congestion, 
ESRD requiring dialysis, DM2 and an AMI.  
.  
#AMI: patient was asymptomatic but was found to have largely 
elevated troponins at the OSH.  He does have ESRD which 
obviously affects the troponin clearence in the blood.  He was 
continued on a heparin gtt originially on admission.  This is 
was stopped secondary to bleeding.  Unsure about appropriate 
medical regimen given his extensive history and RV dysplasia. 
Has tried BB in past but had symptomatic hypotension from it. 
Likely no statin given his liver function. Not on an ACEI 
currently. Has h/o GI bleed- so careful with anticoagulation. 
Probably reason he is not on ASA. While in the hospital an ASA 
was started. 
.  
#h/o multiple arrhythmias: s/p multiple ablations. pacer in 
place. EP consult in AM to evaluate pacer and found it to be 
functioning well.
.  
#PAF: Continued his home amiodarone and was monitored on 
telemetry.  The issue of anticoagulation is discussed above.   
.  
#DM2: patient not on medications on transfer. Will start with 
humalog sliding scale and add standing insulin based on 24 hour 
usage.  His fingersticks were monitored and found to always be 
within the 100-150 range qAC.  He was placed on an insulin SS 
with humalog but did not require any use of insulin. 
.  
#ESRD: requires dialysis T, TH, SA.  The renal fellow was 
notified and made recommendations regarding his nephrocaps and 
phoslo and calcitriol.  He underwent dialysis as schedule.  
.  
#Chronic hepatic congestion: requires paracentesis twice a week. 
 He was monitored closely and a therapeutic paracentesis was 
performed on [**2770-1-12**].
.  
#Right-sided and left-sided heart failure: from RV dysplasia.  
He was placed on a 1L fluid restriction and a CXR on admission 
showed no evidence of fluid overload.  As above, he was 
monitored for ascites build up. 
.  
#erythematous right knee: considered gout flare at OSH given 
this is a recurrent site for him. Given WBC and diff with bands 
and metamyl, concern for cellulitis. Patient received vancomycin 
at OSH. Continued allopurinol and stopped colchicine secondary 
renal insufficiency.  Rheumatology was consulted and tapped his 
pre-patellar bursa three times to remove fluid.  It grew out 
Staph aureas which was MSSA.  Vancomycin was changed to 
nafcillin.  Ortho was consulted for concern over a septic joint. 
 Despite pain in his knee, the patient was able to ambulate on 
the joint and it was believed the infection was not in the joint 
itself.  Ortho did decided to take him to surgery for a wash out 
procedure.  During the procedure he developed hypotension which 
continued in the PACU.  He was transferred to the CCU. He never 
recovered from the procedure and expired in the CCU. His family 
wanted an autopsy performed.
.  
#hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine.  TFTs were WNL. 
.  
#Code status: Full code

     CHEST, AP PORTABLE SINGLE VIEW
     
     INDICATION:  End-stage renal disease, CHF, ascites, and pacemaker, confirm
     line placement.
     
     FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
     supine position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with a previous
     chest examination ([**2770-1-7**] AP view with patient in upright
     position).
     
     Comparison indicates marked cardiac enlargement status post sternotomy
     presumably related to previous bypass surgery.  A permanent pacer is seen in
     right anterior axillary position.  Total of three intracavitary electrodes are
     identified, one of which with the two enforcements indicating an ICD.  The
     other wires terminate in position of the right atrial appendage and the apical
     portion of the right ventricle correspondingly.  There is no pulmonary
     vascular congestion, nor is there any evidence of pneumothorax or acute
     infiltrates.  Observed is the presence of a catheter sheath combination
     located in the left upper area above the pulmonary apex.  It is possible that
     this relates to a subclavian placed line which under such circumstances is
     directed in cranial rather than mediastinal direction.  Effort is made to
     reach referring physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 527**]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 8033**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8034**].

     Limited focused portable ultrasound of the gallbladder and liver were
     performed. Note is made of significant ascites.  No focal liver lesions. The
     gallbladder is visualized and is relatively unremarkable.  An area of
     increased echogenicity is identified on the anterior wall.  This does not
     appear to move with positioning.  However the appearances are most likely
     consistent with cholelithiasis.  The common bile duct measures 0.6 cm, which
     is within normal limits for the patient's age.  No evidence of any gallbladder

     Very mild interstitial edema which developed on [**1-13**] is unchanged. 
     Severe cardiomegaly is longstanding.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
     effusion.  Mediastinal venous engorgement suggests elevated central venous

     right ventricular pacer defibrillator lead are unchanged in their positions;
     the proximal electrode of the defibrillator traverses the SVC and upper right
     atrium, and the tip projects superiorly over the right ventricular apex.
     
     The left subclavian sheath still heads cephalad presumably into the internal

CODE STATUS: after consultation with physicians pts wife, the HCP made pt DNR/DNI. Treatment will continue, but no resusitative efforts made.
ID: Pt remains afebrile with temp ~97 po. No longer on barehugger. WBCs decreased to 11.3 (13.1). He is receiving flagyl and ceftriaxone and vanco by level.
CV: Pt started the day with maps in the mid 50s despite maxed out dopamine 20mic/kilo and levo at .3mic/kilo. Vasopressin was started at 0945 at 1.2u/hr. He was increased to 2.4u at 11:15 and has tolerated it well. At the same time pacer was reprogramed to vvi with  rate of 50 to prevent pacing. Both of these changes have improved maps to 60s and levophed has been decreased to .09mic/kilo and can probably come off. Dopamine is to remain at 20 mic/kilo for now. A venous sat was drawn off the subclavian line that was known to be going retrograde. It gave a CO of 6.0/2.8 with SVR 453. At 1600, after receiving 1 U FFP, another attempt at line placement, now under fluro was done. A swan was floated, but it was not possible to advance it beyond RA, most likely due to lg RV. At a result the PA port is RA, the RA port is in the cortis and blood cannot be drawn from it, the RA infusion port is likewise not useable. THe RV infusion port is usable as is the cortis. His pressures have been moved from his dialysis line to the sideport of the swan with new tubing.The site is eccymotic, but there is no oozing. All pulses are dopplerable. Feet and all extremities are only slightly cool. 
RENAL: Pt remained on CCVHD, tolerating dialysis well, but have no fluid removal. The filter clotted at 1800, just as line was in. RRT has been temporarily stopped until new filter can be primed. He is 4.5 liters pos for the day and 7.2 liters LOS. 
RESP: Pts sats unreliable due to periferal vasoconstriction. Last GAs on 35% neb was 7.31/41/75/23. Breath sound decreased. Pt has fairly strong cough.
GI: Pt kept NPO as he is unsafe swallowing. He has ultrasound of acites and later was tapped for sample to send to lab.
SKIN: Dsg on R lower leg changed by ortho. Area very bloody, and open, but appears clean. He has lg eccymotic area on R abdomen, perhaps from recent paricentesis which he has 2 X week. Some skin tears noted on R anticub, but otherwise skin has no breakdown at this point.
MS: Pt intially very somnulent and barely responsive. Speak was incomprehensible, and he followed no commands. With improved hemodynamics he is able to say his name and follow some simple commands. He responds to his family who visited most of the day. He does not seem to be in pain when left alone. He had significant pain with dsg change. He receives fentanyl 12.5-25 IV for pain. 
A: Improved hemodynamics on vasopressin/weaning levo/dnr/dni
P: continue weaning levo as tolerated. Restart CVVHD when possible. Monitor I & O. Cont with ABX. Due for labs at 10pm. Monitor for pain.
