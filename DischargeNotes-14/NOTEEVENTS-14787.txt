     PA AND LATERAL RADIOGRAPH.  No prior studies for comparison.
     
     The lung volumes are slightly reduced.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours
     are within normal limits.  There are increased interstitial opacities and
     septal thickening seen in both lung fields diffusely.  There are no focal
     consolidations or definite pleural effusions.  The patient is post median
     sternotomy and CABG with sternal wires and surgical clips seen.  The osseous
     structure demonstrate degenerative changes, as well as a compression deformity
     of an upper-lumbar vertebral body.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Findings consistent with congestive heart failure.  Upper lumbar
     compression deformity of indeterminate age.

     HISTORY:  Seventy-three year old female with known CAD, who presents for  
     preoperative evaluation prior to vascular surgery.   
      
     SUMMARY OF EXERCISE DATA FROM THE REPORT OF THE EXERCISE LAB: 
     Dipyridamole was infused intravenously for 4 minutes at a dose of 0.142
     mg/kg/min. Two minutes after the cessation of infusion, Tc-99m sestamibi was
     administered IV. 
     The patient had intermittent [**3-30**] chest tightness during infusion. 
     There were no ST changes. 
      
     INTERPRETATION:  
     Image Protocol: Gated SPECT. 
     Resting perfusion images were obtained with thallium-201. 
     Tracer was injected 15 minutes prior to obtaining the resting images. 
      
     Stress images show moderate perfusion defects in the anterior and lateral walls.
      The anterior wall defect resolved completely on resting images, and the
     lateral wall defect partially resolves.  
      
     Ejection fraction calculated from gated wall motion images obtained after
     Dipyridamole administration is 41%, with global hypokinesis. 
      
     IMPRESSION:  1) Moderate, reversible anterior wall defect.  2) Moderate,
     partially reversible lateral wall defect.  3) Global hypokinesis with EF 41%.   
      
     The findings were conveyed to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4672**], at the time of interpretation.

She has know LAD lesion from MIBI. She was in failure and was on natricor and heparin. Her creatinine bumped from 1.3 to 1.9 on [**6-29**] and natricor was stopped. She had chest pain [**6-29**] in the evening with changes that resolved with 2 SL nitros. She was tranfered to CCU today for swan. After arriving it was decided not to swan her. She may receive cath tomorrow.

RESP: She continues to have rales up ~[**1-21**], but is sating beter now being 98-99% on 3L NP. She can lie nearly flat comfortably.
RENAL: Despite diuresis she is only 100cc neg for the day and 400cc pos LOS. 
GI: Pt has poor apetite. She ate no breakfast after cath was cancelled
but did eat lunch. No BM.
ENDO: She had 1/2 dose NPH at breakfast plus 4u reg insuin. At noon blood sugar was 249. She received 12u reg insulin. She should get usual dose of NPH at ~5pm.

     Reason: pls carry out doppler study to assess for renal artery steno
     Admitting Diagnosis: RIGHT FOOT ULCER-CELLULITIS-DIABETES
     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      73 year old woman with CHF, DM, s/p CABG, s/p multiple caths, PAD/PVD s/p SFA 
      stent.  Patient with refractory HTN, episodes of flash pulm edema.  Unable to 
      lye flat for MR study.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      pls carry out doppler study to assess for renal artery stenosis.                
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Refractory hypertension, status post multiple caths with
     peripheral vascular disease/pulmonary edema and unable to lie flat for MRI
     study.
     
     There are no prior studies for comparison.
     
     RENAL ULTRASOUND:  The right kidney measures 11.0 cm.  The left kidney
     measures 10.7 cm.  There are no hydronephrosis or masses.   There are several
     shadowing echogenic foci within the right kidney, possibly representing small
     non-obstructing stones.
     
     Color and duplex examination of the kidneys was performed for evaluation of
     the renal vasculature.  The examination was somewhat limited due to the
     patient's inability to breath-hold.  Several normal-appearing wave forms are
     demonstrated bilaterally with normal upstroke and diastolic flow.  Normal
     resistive indices are demonstrated.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  No hydronephrosis or masses.
     2.  Limited duplex examination of the kidneys with demonstration of several
     normal-appearing wave forms making the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis
     unlikely.
