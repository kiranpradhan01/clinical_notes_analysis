Service: MEDICINE
 
Allergies: 
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs
 
Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2289**] 
Chief Complaint:
fever/hypoxia
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none
 
History of Present Illness:
HPI: 62M with hx of schizophrenia, dementia, recurrent pneumonia 
 presents to the ER with worsening shortness of breath x 1 day.  
Per transfer notes, pt was found to be febrile this am to 101 
(rectal) with pulse of 103, RR 44 and O2 of 89% on 2L.  He was 
given a duoneb for wheezing and tylenol for the fever and 
transferred to [**Hospital1 19**].  Of note, pt was recently hospitalized at 
both [**Hospital1 1072**] and NEBH for pneumonia.  He was found down at his 
nursing home on [**10-15**] with a swollen right shoulder.  He was 
taken to [**Hospital1 1072**] and diagnosed with a RLL PNA and a right humeral 
neck fracture.  He was initially started on levaquin but then 
switched to Vancomycin for MRSA pneumonia.  He received 14 days 
of vancomycin through a L-sided PICC (last dose on [**3306-10-29**]).  A 
repeat CXR on [**11-3**] showed a persistent right basilar infiltrate 
and he was started on clindamycin.  On [**11-5**], pt was found to be 
lethargic with a temp of 101.7 and O2 sat of 82% on 2L.   He was 
then admitted to NEBH and started on linezolid.  This was 
continued for 14 days and finished on [**11-17**].  Also during this 
admission, pt had a PEG tube placed due to chronic dysphagia and 
dehydration (cr to 2.0).  He was discharged back to his nursing 
home on [**11-12**] and was doing well until the day prior to 
admission.
.
In the ER, pt was 88% on 6L.  He was given combivent nebs x 3, 
steroids, ceftriaxone/vanc(given hx of MRSA) and he improved to 
100% on 2L.  A CTA was done given his tachypnea and it showed no 
PE but bilateral pleural effusions with atelectasis vs 
infiltrate on the right.  It also showed his right humeral neck 
fracture.
 
Past Medical History:
* Dementia
* Schizophrenia
* hx of recurrent pneumonia, most recently treated in 10/06 with 
linezolid (finished on [**11-17**])
* Insulin dependent diabetes
* HTN
* COPD/emphysema on 92-93% on 2L chronically
* high cholesterol
 
Social History:
- lives at [**Location **] Health Care Center
 
Family History:
not obtainable [**2-18**] mental status
 
Physical Exam:
Exam: temp 101.2 --> 99, BP 128/89, HR 96, R 23, O2 98% on 2L 
--> 93% on RA, I/O: 2.2/320
Gen: awake, tracking across the room with his eyes, nonverbal
HEENT: MM dry, PERRL, EOMI
Neck: rigid, no appreciable JVD
CV: tachy, regular, no murmurs
Chest: crackles throughout, no wheezes
Abd: PEG tube in place, site appears clean/dry/intact; 
nontender, nondistended, +BS
ext: no edema, 2+DP; rigid, increased tone in all ext
neuro: nonverbal at baseline, rigid extremities, hyperreflexic 
R>L; upgoing toes bilaterally, not following commands
 
Pertinent Results:
CXR: Cardiomegaly.  Congestive heart failure.  The underlying 
infectious process cannot be excluded. 
.
CTA chest:
1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism. 
2.  Bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent compressive 
atelectasis versus infiltrates. 
3.  Prominent bilateral hilar and subcarinal soft tissue likely 
represents lymphadenopathy. 
4.  Comminuted, impacted fracture of the right humeral neck, 
incompletely evaluated on this CT of the chest. Recommend plain 
films of right shoulder. 
5.  Cardiomegaly with moderate coronary artery atherosclerotic 
calcifications.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) RESP:  Pt presents with recently with recurring pneumonia in 
RLL s/p ~1 month of antibiotic treatment, presenting now with 
recurrent fevers, increased work of breathing and hypoxia.  (of 
note, at baseline, pt is 92-93% on 2L).  Ddx included new 
pneumonia, partially treated PNA over past month, aspiration 
PNA, loculated pleural effusion (although pt's effusions were 
not felt to be substantial effusion on bedside USN [**11-25**] AM).  
CHF and COPD flare were felt unlikely given lack of wheezing, 
good air movement, and impression that pt was hypovolemic.  Pt 
was rapidly tapered off of steroids.  PE unlikely given negative 
CTA. 
.
Pt was put on empiric antibiotics with cefepime and vanco.  
Micro work up revealed klebsiella in sputum so pt was continued 
on cefepime only for a 7 day course.  With this, his fevers 
resolved.  His oxygenation improved as well.  He was ruled out 
for Tb with AFB sputum x 3 (negative).
.
CTA of chest did reveal lymphadenopathy.  Initial consideration 
was for bronch but given active pneumonia, pulmonary consult 
recommended waiting 6-8 weeks to see if lymphadenopathy resolves 
with resolution of pneumonia.  (Pt was seen by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] 
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2555**]).  If lymphaden persistes, pt can be 
referred to pulm for possible bronchoscopy.
.
2) C DIFF:  Checked given fever and came back positive.  Started 
on flagyl.  Last day will of 2 week course will be [**12-9**]. 
.
3) CHF:  Pt did appear volume overloaded after initial ICU 
course and volume repletion.  Echo showed severely depressed EF 
of 20-25% and PA HTN, which were known previously.  Pt was 
periodically diuresed with lasix.  He was started on ACE-I, 
continued on beta blocker.  He was not discharged with any 
standing lasix.
.
4) Anemia:  Hct ranged between 23 and 30 while at NEBH.  Most 
recent hct from nursing home was 32.9 on [**11-17**].  During the last 
week of hospitalization, Hct stable in 29-30 range.  Restarted 
outpt iron.
.
5) Fracture of humerus: Appeared to be old (dating back to 
[**10-16**]); spoke with ortho [**11-24**] who recommended plain films which 
showed callus formation suggesting prior injury.  Pt can f/u 
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 893**] of ortho ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 177**]) after discharge.
.
6) Schizophrenia:  Continued on risperdal.

     REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Hypoxia, fever and cough.
     
     Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed with no benefit of comparison to the
     previous film.  The heart is markedly enlarged.  The mediastinum is
     unremarkable.  Perihilar and lower lung opacities with interstitial prominence
     and areas of air space consolidation are most likely due to pulmonary edema.
     The underlying infectious process cannot be excluded.  The pleural effusion
      is small.  There is no pneumothorax.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Cardiomegaly.  Congestive heart failure.  The underlying
     infectious process cannot be excluded.

     CTA OF THE CHEST
     
     INDICATION:  62-year-old male with worsening shortness of breath, fever.
     Please evaluate for pulmonary embolism/pneumonia.
     
     COMPARISON:  No prior study available for comparison.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Continuous MDCT-acquired axial images were obtained from the
     thoracic inlet to the upper abdomen before and after the administration of
     intravenous contrast.  100 cc of Optiray intravenous contrast were
     administered via pulmonary embolism protocol.  Multiplanar reformatted images
     were obtained and reviewed.
     
     CTA CHEST:  There is mild cardiomegaly.  The pericardium and great vessels are
     unremarkable.  There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism.  There is no
     evidence of aortic dissection.  There is no significant axillary
     lymphadenopathy, but there is bilateral prominent soft tissue in the regions
     of the hila and subcarinal space, which likely represents lymphadenopathy. The
     central airways are patent bilaterally.  There are bilateral pleural
     effusions, greater on the right than on the left, with adjacent infiltrate
     versus compressive atelectasis.  There are bilateral mild apical bullous
     changes, without evidence of diffuse emphysema.  Note is made of moderate
     coronary artery atherosclerotic calcification.
     
     Incidental note is made of a comminuted, partially impacted fracture of the
     right humeral neck.  This is incompletely evaluated on this study as CT slices
     did not extend superiorly and laterally enough to completely evaluate the
     entire shoulder.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
     
     2.  Bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent compressive atelectasis versus
     infiltrates.
     
     3.  Prominent bilateral hilar and subcarinal soft tissue likely represents
     lymphadenopathy.
     
     4.  Comminuted, impacted fracture of the right humeral neck, incompletely
     evaluated on this CT of the chest. Recommend plain films of right shoulder.

     COMPARISON:  CXR  [**3306-11-23**].
     
     FINDINGS:  Upright portable radiograph of the chest.  Marked enlargement of
     the heart is again identified.  The mediastinum appears unchanged.  Interval
     increase in retrocardiac density is identified consistent with atelectasis
     versus consolidation.  Additionally, another patchy area of consolidation is
     identified at the right lung base likely consistent with a developing
     pneumonia.  A tiny left-sided pleural effusion may be likely.  Previously
     identified fracture of the right humeral head is again seen and appears
     unchanged.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Increased retrocardiac density at left base consistent with
     atelectasis versus consolidation.  Worsening patchy consolidation at right
     base, likely consistent with developing pneumonia.
