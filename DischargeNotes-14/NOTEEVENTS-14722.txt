Admission Date:  [**3391-5-2**]       Discharge Date:  [**3391-5-7**]

Date of Birth:   [**3316-6-12**]       Sex:  M

Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74-year-old
male with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and a long
history of cigarette smoking; who was in his usual state of
health until he developed some unstable angina.  The patient
was transferred from an outside hospital for cardiac
catheterization at our facility.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Diabetes.
3.  Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
4.  Peripheral neuropathy.
5.  Osteoarthritis.
6.  Lyme disease.
7.  Asbestosis.
8.  Colonic polyps.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:   No previous past surgical history.

ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   This 74-year-old man, who was transferred
to our facility, underwent cardiac catheterization.

Catheterization revealed an 80% stenosis of the proximal left
anterior descending artery, and an 80% stenosis of the obtuse
marginal, with a normal left ventricular ejection fraction.

Based on these findings, Cardiothoracic Surgery was consulted
and the patient was deemed appropriate for a coronary artery
bypass graft.  So, on [**3391-5-3**], the patient was taken
to the operating room where he underwent a coronary artery
bypass graft.  His grafts were left internal mammary artery
to the second diagonal and saphenous vein graft to obtuse
marginal.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, and
there were no complications.

Postoperatively, he was transferred to the Cardiothoracic
Surgery Recovery Unit where he was maintained briefly on
pressors.  The patient woke up extubated and was weaned off
of his pressor support.

On postoperative day two, he was transferred out of the
Intensive Care Unit to the floor, where his chest tubes and
Foley catheter were removed, and his pacing wires were
removed.  His diet was advanced.  He worked with Physical
Therapy, and he was deemed to be a candidate for
rehabilitation and was to be discharged there on
postoperative day four.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To rehabilitation.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.h.s.
2.  Glucophage 500 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3.  Acetylsalicylic acid 325 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Metoprolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. (for seven days).
6.  Potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o. b.i.d. (for seven days).
7.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
8.  Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.

     COMPARISONS:  [**3391-5-6**] at 11:15 hours.
     
     PA AND LATERAL CHEST:  Sternotomy wires are unchanged.  Cardiac, mediastinal
     and hilar contours are stable.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal.  Scattered
     linear opacities in the lungs are suggestive of subsegmental atelectasis or
     scarring. There is stable pleural thickening and calcified plaques with
     associated blunting of bilateral CP angles, consistent with asbestos exposure.
     Small bilateral pleural effusions are also possible. No pneumothorax is seen.
     
     IMPRESSION: No pneumothorax. No change from prior study performed 3 hrs prior.
