Brief Hospital Course:
Injury
C-spine [**2-9**] and T-spine 4 fracture
.
Patiemt was fused by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 207**], after that she remained stable. 
The desitionn to perform a tracheosty and gastrostomy was made 
and corroborated with the family and health proxy.After the 
gastric tube was placed percutaneously tube feeding could not be 
advance due to increased residuals then a ct scan of the abdomen 
was done:
[**5-13**] CT [**Last Name (un) **]: free air. RE: Pt had g tube placed after pt not 
tolerating TF tru GT, so ct scan done showed free air  wich is a 
normal finding after this procedure. Since pt failed several 
attempts to be feed by gt [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] jejunal tube was placed for 
feeding and, was able to be advanced.
Previous studies:
[**5-12**] KUB: Increased Intra-abd air
[**5-8**] CXR: free air in abdomen unchanged
[**5-7**] gastric contrast: no extravasation

MRI spine: cord edema c1-c3, vessels intact, spinal cord 
stenosis at c3, likely secondary to djd [**5-26**] CXR: increased L 
effusion, stable retrocardiac effusion; [**5-22**] CT Head: no ICH; 
[**5-21**] CXR: bilat effusions, intra-abd air; [**5-19**] KUB: Stable intra 
abdominal air. [**5-13**] CT [**Last Name (un) **]: free air; [**5-12**] KUB: Increased 
Intra-abd air; [**5-8**] CXR: free air in abdomen unchanged; [**5-7**] 
gastric contrast: no extravasation; [**5-6**] CXR: Free air in Abd; 
[**5-2**] MRA neck: no stenosis, aneurysm, R knee: no fx, effusion+, 
CT torso: T4 vertebral body fx, CT c-spine: C2 post vertebral 
body fxs, traverses B neural foramina, C3 spinous process fx, 
widening of the C2-3 anterior disc space with grade 1 
retrolisthesis at C5 and C5-6, MRI spine: cord edema c1-c3, 
vessels intact, spinal cord stenosis at c3, likely secondary to 
djd  
EEG: no epileptiform activity, ? widespread encephalopathy

delirium. For now, plan is to pursue vent rehab. 
 
Plan: 
1) D/C ambien (deliriogenic). Would use olanzapine as PRN for 
insomnia. 
2) D/C metoclopromide -- often causes akathisia which could 
contribute to general sense of discomfort which may be difficult 

to detect given paralysis. 
3) Check full thyroid panel and replete given hypothyroidism. 
Low thyroid may contribute to delirium.

     INDICATION:  76-year-old female with weakness.
     
     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  T1- and T2-weighted images, sagittal and axial images of the
     lumbar spine were obtained.
     
     FINDINGS:  The vertebral body heights are well maintained.  A mixed density
     fat and soft tissue lesion within the S1 vertebral body is consistent with a
     hemangioma.  The conus terminates normally at L1 and has normal signal
     characteristics.  There is multilevel degenerative change with disc
     desiccation at all levels.  There is grade-1 retrolisthesis of L2 on L3 with a
     central disc protrusion causing moderate canal stenosis and bilateral neural
     foraminal narrowing.  At L3-4, there is a mild disc bulge. There is also mild
     facet hypertrophy at this level.  However, no evidence of spinal stenosis or
     neural foraminal narrowing is noted.  Grade-1 anterolisthesis of L4 on L5 is
     also identified. A central disc protrusion at this level causes bilateral
     neural foraminal narrowing with moderate spinal stenosis.  At L5-S1, a mild
     disc bulge produces slight indentation of the thecal sac.  The visualized
     paraspinal soft tissue is unremarkable.  The distal spinal cord shows normal
     signal intensities.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Multilevel degenerative change causing mild-to-moderate spinal
     stenosis as described above.

     INDICATION:  76-year-old female with weakness and history of C2 fracture.
     
     COMPARISONS:  CT cervical spine dated [**3422-5-2**].
     
     MRI OF THE CERVICAL SPINE.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Sagittal T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and STIR images and axial T2-
     weighted and gradient-echo images were obtained.
     
     FINDINGS:  The vertebral bodies demonstrate normal alignment.  There is
     swelling and a small fluid collection involving the the C2-C4 prevertebral
     tissues. The anterior longitudinal ligament appears intact.  There is mild
     marrow edema at the site of the previously described C2 fracture. Increased
     signal intensity is identified within the spinal cord from the C2-C3 level,
     consistent with edema.  Susceptibility artifact is also identified at these
     levels consistent with spinal cord hematoma. High signal intensity involving
     the C2-C5 paraspinal muscles, and a linear focus of increased signal
     transversing the ligamentum flavum at C2-3 are concerning for possible
     ligamentous injury.  Please note that the sensitivity of MRI for detection of
     ligamentous injury is unknown. T2 hyperintensity involving the bilateral C2
     facet joints may represent injury to the posterior elements.
     
     From C2-C4, no spinal stenosis is identified.
     
     At C4- C5, there is a midline disc protrusion and thickening of the ligamentum
     flavum causing mild canal stenosis.
     
     At C5- C6, there is a mild disc bulge without neural foraminal or canal
     stenosis.
     
     At C6- C7, a midline protrusion and disc space osteophytes produce mild
     relative stenosis of the spinal canal.
     
     At C7-T1, a central protrusion indents the cord without neural foraminal
     narrowing.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Spinal cord edema and contusion at the level of C2 through C3 as described

     posterior paraspinal muscles and facet joints indicating possible injury to
     the posterior elements.
     3.  Multilevel spondylosis as described above with some stenosis of the spinal
     canal.
     
     MRA NECK:
     
     Limited images of the carotid and vertebral arteries demonstrate flow without
     significant areas of stenosis or aneurysmal dilatation.
     
     MR [**Name13 (STitle) 429**]:
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Sagittal T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and STIR images and axial T2-
     weighted and gradient-echo images were obtained.
     
     The thoracic spinal cord is of normal size and signal intensity.  Vertebral
     bodies are normally aligned.  The subarachnoid space is well maintained. There
     is increased signal intensity in the T7-8 disc space, which may represent
     fluid within a degenerated disc and less likely infection.  A small disc bulge
     at this level produces flattening of the thecal sac without neural foraminal
     narrowing.  The visualized paraspinal soft tissue is unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No evidence of thoracic cord compression or epidural collection.
     Increased T7-8 disc signal, which may represent fluid within a degenerated
     disc or less likely infection.  No surrounding abnormality is identified
     within the paraspinal soft tissues.

                                     FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
     INDICATION:  76-year-old female with cervical spine fracture.
     
     COMPARISONS:  No prior studies are available at this institution for
     comparison.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axial images were obtained throughout the cervical spine
     without contrast.  Sagittal and coronal reconstructions were performed.
     
     FINDINGS:  Nasogastric and endotracheal tube are identified.  C1 through T1
     are well visualized.  There is an obliquely oriented fracture transversing the
     posterior base of the C2 vertebral body with extension into the bilateral
     neural foramina.  No bony fragments are identified within the cervical canal.
     A fracture is also identified through the C3 spinous process.  The
     atlantoaxial and atlanto-occipital relationships are maintained.  There is
     widening of the anterior C2/C3 disc space which may represent extension
     injury. Grade 1 anterolisthesis is also identified at C4-C5.  There is
     multilevel degenerative change with facet hypertrophy, loss of disc space
     height, endplate sclerosis and anterior osteophytes, most prominent at C4-5
     and C6-7.  There is diffuse bony demineralization.  Extensive calcifications
     are seen within the carotid arteries.  Air-fluid levels are identified within
     the right sphenoid sinus and left maxillary sinus, possibly secondary to
     intubation.  There is moderate prevertebral soft tissue swelling.  The
     visualized lung apices are clear.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  C2 posterior vertebral body fracture which transverses the bilateral
     neural foramina.  CTA of the neck is recommended to evaluate for injury to the
     vertebral arteries.
     2.  C3 spinous process fracture.
     3.  Widening of the C2-3 anterior disc space with grade 1 retrolisthesis
     identified at C5 and C5-6.  If high clinical suspicion for ligamentous injury,
     an MR of the cervical spine to be performed.  These findings were discussed
     with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 552**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at 5:40 p.m. on [**3422-5-2**].

     INDICATION:  76-year-old female with weakness and history of C2 fracture.
     
     COMPARISONS:  CT cervical spine dated [**3422-5-2**].
     
     MRI OF THE CERVICAL SPINE.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Sagittal T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and STIR images and axial T2-
     weighted and gradient-echo images were obtained.
     
     FINDINGS:  The vertebral bodies demonstrate normal alignment.  There is
     swelling and a small fluid collection involving the the C2-C4 prevertebral
     tissues. The anterior longitudinal ligament appears intact.  There is mild
     marrow edema at the site of the previously described C2 fracture. Increased
     signal intensity is identified within the spinal cord from the C2-C3 level,
     consistent with edema.  Susceptibility artifact is also identified at these
     levels consistent with spinal cord hematoma. High signal intensity involving
     the C2-C5 paraspinal muscles, and a linear focus of increased signal
     transversing the ligamentum flavum at C2-3 are concerning for possible
     ligamentous injury.  Please note that the sensitivity of MRI for detection of
     ligamentous injury is unknown. T2 hyperintensity involving the bilateral C2
     facet joints may represent injury to the posterior elements.
     
     From C2-C4, no spinal stenosis is identified.
     
     At C4- C5, there is a midline disc protrusion and thickening of the ligamentum
     flavum causing mild canal stenosis.
     
     At C5- C6, there is a mild disc bulge without neural foraminal or canal
     stenosis.
     
     At C6- C7, a midline protrusion and disc space osteophytes produce mild
     relative stenosis of the spinal canal.
     
     At C7-T1, a central protrusion indents the cord without neural foraminal
     narrowing.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Spinal cord edema and contusion at the level of C2 through C3 as described
                                                                 (Over)

     above.
     2.  Prevertebral soft tissue swelling and increased signal intensity in the
     posterior paraspinal muscles and facet joints indicating possible injury to
     the posterior elements.
     3.  Multilevel spondylosis as described above with some stenosis of the spinal
     canal.
     
     MRA NECK:
     
     Limited images of the carotid and vertebral arteries demonstrate flow without
     significant areas of stenosis or aneurysmal dilatation.
     
     MR [**Name13 (STitle) 429**]:
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Sagittal T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and STIR images and axial T2-
     weighted and gradient-echo images were obtained.
     
     The thoracic spinal cord is of normal size and signal intensity.  Vertebral
     bodies are normally aligned.  The subarachnoid space is well maintained. There
     is increased signal intensity in the T7-8 disc space, which may represent
     fluid within a degenerated disc and less likely infection.  A small disc bulge
     at this level produces flattening of the thecal sac without neural foraminal
     narrowing.  The visualized paraspinal soft tissue is unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No evidence of thoracic cord compression or epidural collection.
     Increased T7-8 disc signal, which may represent fluid within a degenerated
     disc or less likely infection.  No surrounding abnormality is identified
     within the paraspinal soft tissues.

     IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**5-2**] and 29:
     
     Tracheostomy tube in standard placement.  Longitudinal collection of air to
     the left of the midline in the lower mediastinum is probably distended
     esophagus but some pneumomediastinum is present above the level of the aortic
     arch, contiguous with mild subcutaneous emphysema in the neck. There is
     no pneumothorax.  Right lower lobe atelectasis has improved substantially.
     Small right pleural effusion has been present since [**5-4**].  The small
     region of infection or infarction at the base of the right lung is either
     resolved or is obscured by residual atelectasis and overlying pleural
     effusion.  Left lower lobe atelectasis is new.  Pneumoperitoneum still
     substantial.  The PEG should be evaluated to see if there is extravasation
     from the stomach which is significantly distended with air and some fluid.
     
     Heart size is top normal.
     
     Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6900**] and I discussed these findings at the time of dictation.

     HISTORY:  76-year-old female with increasing free intraabdominal air, status
     post PEG with concern for gastric extravasation.
     
     ABDOMEN, FOUR VIEWS:  Supine and left lateral decubitus abdominal radiographs
     were obtained immediately after the injection of approximately 100 mL of
     Conray contrast into the patient's percutaneous gastrostomy tube.  Supine and
     left lateral decubitus films were also obtained approximately one half hour
     later.  There is contrast present within the fundus of the stomach without
     evidence of extravasation outside of the stomach.  There is a significant
     amount of free air layering under both hemidiaphragms.  Air is present
     throughout both normal caliber large and small bowel and extends to the
     rectum.  There is no evidence of obstruction.  Surgical clips are noted over
     the right mid abdomen.  A percutaneous gastrostomy remains in appropriate
     position.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Contrast within the fundus of the stomach without evidence of
     extravasation outside of the stomach.  Given that the distal stomach is not
     demonstrated to fill with contrast, further imaging after positioning the
     patient right lateral decubitus is suggested to definitively assess for
     gastric leak.  There is persistent free intraabdominal air.

     pneumoperitoneum.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT through the abdomen and pelvis with oral
     contrast.  Axial images were obtained from the bases of the lungs through the
     symphysis pubis.
     
     Comparison is made with prior study dated [**3422-5-2**].
     
     ABDOMEN CT WITH ORAL CONTRAST:
     
     In the limited images obtained throughout the bases of the lungs, there are
     bilateral pleural effusions with atelectasis of the adjacent segmental basal
     posterior lobes.  There are coronary and aortic calcifications.  There is
     calcification of the mitral valve.
     
     Allowing for the lack of the IV contrast, the liver, spleen, and adrenal

Social Work

Family meeting was held to discuss pt's present condition and decisions around future care.  Present were pt's daughters, husband, grandchildren and sister, as well as the team.  Pt's living will was discussed, which would need to be used as a guide if pt is unable to convey her wishes re: continued care or not.  Pt is currently under sedation, but will be taken off sedation to be assessed for capacity by psych.  If pt is capable, she will be informed about her poor prognosis and asked if she would like to continue artificial means to support her.  Pt's husband and HCP, [**Doctor Last Name 48**], refused to make a decision re: continued care if pt is assessed as not having capacity to make that decision.  Instead, he indicated that pt's alternate HCP, [**Doctor Last Name 261**] (pt's daughter) could make the decision for him.  SW spoke with the legal department who indicated that the husband would be able to pass the decision to the alternate HCP.  Family are considering what to decide if pt is unable to make the decision for herself.

Family requested that a priest be called to talk with pt about end of life issues, which SW will do if/when pt is clear.  Another family meeting was planned for this Thursday at 2pm to make a decision.  Ethics, psych, SW, and the rest of team will be requested to attend.  SW will continue to follow closely.
