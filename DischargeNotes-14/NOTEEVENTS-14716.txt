     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      59 year old man with cirrhosis, and restrictive lung disease.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      This gentleman has features of restrictive lung disease.  Please perform high
      resolution CT of chest to see if there is interstitial pneumonitis/fibrosinf
      alveolitis.
     No contraindications for IV contrast
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: Cirrhosis, restrictive lung disease. Please perform high
     resolution CT to see if there is interstitial pneumonitis or fibrosis.
     
     No comparisons.
     
     TECHNIQUE: CT images of 2.5 mm collimation were obtained of the chest with no
     IV contrast. High resolution images of 1.25 mm collimation were also obtained
     during inspiration and expiration.
     
     CT CHEST AND HIGH RESOLUTION CT CHEST WITH NO IV CONTRAST: Soft tissue windows
     reveal no significant mediastinal, hilar or axillary lymph node enlargement.
     Coronary artery calcifications are noted. There is layering small-to-moderate
     sized left pleural effusion. Incidental note is made of an aberrant right
     subclavian artery.
     
     Lung windows reveal no evidence of significant interstitial abnormality. A
     focal area of opacity is demonstrated in the left lower lobe, likely
     representing atelectasis associated with the effusion. A small calcified
     granuloma is  demonstrated within this area of opacified lung parenchyma.
     Minimal cylindrical bronchiectasis with bronchial wall thickening is
     demonstrated in the right lower lobe. Minimal linear opacities are also
     demonstrated in the apices, likely representing scarring. Bilateral airways
     are patent to the level of the segmental bronchi.
     
     A small hiatal hernia is demonstrated. In the imaged portion of the upper
     abdomen, a nodular appearance of the liver is demonstrated, consistent with
     the patient's known cirrhosis. There is moderate-to-large amount of ascites
     and associated mesenteric stranding. Extensive intra-abdominal varices are
     noted. There appears to be a small ventral hernia containing fat and varices.
     
     Bone windows reveal no significant abnormality.
     
     The expiration images demonstrated no significant air-trapping.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. No evidence of significant interstitial lung disease.
     2. Left lower lobe opacity, most likely due to passive atelectasis associated
     with a small- to- moderate left pleural effusion. Pneumonia cannot be
     completely excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
     3. Minimal cylindrical bronchiectasis in the right lower lobe.
                                                                 (Over)

esterase, [**12-24**] reds, 0-2 whites, few bacteria, and no
squamous epi's.

Chest x-ray showed retrocardiac density.  Abdominal
ultrasound showed small ascites.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  A 59-year-old male with end-stage liver
disease secondary to primary sclerosing cholangitis admitted
with worsening hepatic encephalopathy and left lower lobe
pneumonia.

1. Encephalopathy:  The patient was given lactulose [**3-9**] bowel
movements a day and was started on Flagyl 500 mg po bid for
decontamination.  He improved on this regimen, and was clear
in his mental status upon discharge.

2. ID:  The patient did have no fever and a normal white
blood cell count, but did have some evidence of pneumonia on
examination and on his chest x-ray with a left lower lobe
infiltrate.  He was initially given ceftriaxone 1 gram po q
day and was switched over to po Levaquin to complete a 10 day
course of antibiotics for his pneumonia.

A diagnostic and mildly therapeutic tap of his ascites was
done that did not show any evidence of SBP.  One liter was
removed from his abdomen.

3. End-stage liver disease:  The patient was continued on his
nadolol, ursodiol.  He initially had his spironolactone held
for lower blood pressures in the 90s, but this was restarted
at 100 mg po q day.  He was also continued on his Protonix 40
mg po q day.

4. Abdominal distention:  Patient had a level of abdominal
distention that was greater than what would be if he just had
ascites.  He had a KUB that did show increased intraluminal
bowel gas that was likely secondary to increased gas
production from his lactulose.  He was started on Flagyl for
decontamination to also try to decrease the gas.  One liter
of ascites was taken off this hospitalization by
paracentesis.

5. Ulcerative colitis:  The patient had no symptoms referable
to this, and was continued on Pentasa 1,000 mg tid.

6. Nutrition:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 11102**] was not taking adequate nutrition
by a calorie count that estimated him around 400-500 calories
per day with a goal of 2,000 calories per day in the
hospital.  He had a post-pyloric tube placed two times during
this hospitalization, but of which the tube was accidentally
pulled out by Mr. [**Known patient lastname 11102**].  It was decided that for
disposition, that he would be followed as an outpatient
Nutrition, Ms. [**Last Name (Titles) 5703**], and the liver service for calorie
count while he was on home food that he preferred more.
He will follow up in the Liver Center for outpatient
nutrition.

He was continued on his multivitamins and given Boost
supplementation.

The patient was discharged home after his encephalopathy
resolved after treatment with lactulose and Flagyl and
treatment of his pneumonia with ceftriaxone.

He will have VNA services at home.  He will actually stay
with his sister.

He will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] within a week.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Spironolactone 100 mg po q day.
2. Flagyl 500 mg po bid.
3. Nadolol 20 mg po q day.
4. Ursodiol 900 mg po bid.
5. Pentasa 1,000 mg tid.
6. Protonix 40 mg po q day.

     Evaluate for left-sided retrocardiac density noted on chest AP view [**2-4**].
     
     FINDINGS: There is a left-sided pleural density which blunts the lateral sinus
     and conceals partially the cardiac contour. Significant cardiac enlargement is
     unlikely. The thoracic aorta is mild widened but otherwise unremarkable. On
     the right side there exists a mild degree of blunting of the lateral sinus. On
     the lateral view a density occupying the entire posterior pleural sinus
     confirms the diagnosis of left-sided pleural effusion. On the AP view we can
     however identify a concavely delineated density occupying the left-sided
     aortodiaphragmatic angle indicative of an atelectatic posterior segment of the
     left lower lobe probably with some parenchymal infiltrate as a spontaneous
     bronchogram can be identified. There is no evidence of CHF and the right-sided
     lung is completely free.
     
     Comparison is made with the previous portable examination and it confirms the
     recommended diagnosis of left lower lobe posterior atelectasis plus
     infiltrate.
     
     Observe that this study is registered on an inappropriate clip number. It has
     been mixed up with the simultaneously obtained plain abdominal examination.

     NONCONTRAST HEAD CT SCAN:
     
     HISTORY:  End stage liver disease, s/p fall, assess for intracranial
     hemorrhage.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast head CT scan.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is no definite interval change compared to the previous
     study, performed for the same reasons, on [**3074-5-6**].  No new area of
     intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect is appreciated.  Once again, there is
     moderate peripheral cerebral atrophy, likely related to the patient's systemic
     disease.
     
     The surrounding osseous and soft tissue structures show no interval changes
     aside from better demonstration of what is likely a left maxillary antral
     mucous retention cyst, partially seen at this time, as well as redemonstration
     of extensive fluid, possibly with associated mucosal thickening nearly
     completely opacifying the dominant left sphenoid air cell.  This latter
     abnormality could represent an allergic or some other type of inflammatory
     process.
     
     CONCLUSION:  No intracranial hemorrhage; sinus abnormalities as noted above.
