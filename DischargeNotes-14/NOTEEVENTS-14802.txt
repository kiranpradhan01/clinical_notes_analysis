Brief Hospital Course:
In the emergency department on [**2587-7-1**], the patient was found to 
be hypotensive with BP 87/59 with an elevated lactate.  He met 
criteria for sepsis and was given levofed and admitted to the 
ICU.  By problem, his course was as follows:

Hypotension: Hypotensive 80s/50s on admission.  BP improved to 
100/50 with IVF, levofed, and Solumedrol.  He remained in the 
ICU, hemodynamically stable, until [**2587-7-4**].  At that point, he 
was transfered to the medical floor.  There, he remained 
hemodynamically stable without need for pressure support.  
Central access was d/c'd on [**2587-7-7**].

Afib: His chronic atrial fibrillation continued with rate 
controlled by diltiazem.  

CHF: He required diuresis for SOB on an almost daily basis.  

SOB:  The patient initially required supplementary O2 via 
non-rebreather mask to maintain O2 saturation in the low 90%'s.  
Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] was persistently tachypniec in the ICU and on the floor, 
and uncomfortably short of breath with movement.  On the floor, 
he maintained O2 saturation 90-94% on 4L O2 via nasal cannula, 
however.  He underwent therapeutic tap of his right pleural 
effusions on [**2587-7-6**] and of his left pleural effusion on 
[**2587-7-9**].  On [**2587-7-10**], the patient became increasingly short of 
breath.  No pneumothorax was present on CXR and PE was 
suspected.  The patient was started on argatroban and transfered 
to the MICU.

Pulm mass: Patient was afebrile with WBC 5.8 on admission.  His 
WBC count rose rapidly despite antibiotic therapy (initially 
ceftriaxone/azithromycin/vancomycin, then 
ceftriaxone/azithromycin, then levofloxacin). The infectious 
disease service was consulted.  On admission, the patient was 
found to have a RUL lesion on CXR and chest CT suspicious for 
TB.  The patient has a history of positive PPD test.  The 
patient underwent bronchoscopy on [**2587-7-3**] that visualized a 
lesion in the right main bronchus.  The lesion was not biopsied 
due to the patient's high INR.  
   Culture data:
       Induced sputum stains were negative x3 for acid-fast 
bacteria. 
       Gram stain showed only respiratory tract flora and yeast. 
 
       Sputum cultures
       Urine cultures
       Perinephric mass fluid cultures

Abdominal mass: An infiltrated perinephric mass, retroperiotneal 
lymphadenopathy, and multiple hepatic lesions were initially 
identified on chest CT.  Their presence was confirmed on 
abdominal/pelvic CT.  On [**2587-7-6**], the patient underwent 
CT-guided biopsy of the perinephric mass.  Lymph node FNA and 
pleural fluid cytology demonstrated a high grade B cell 
lymphoma.

Coagulation: The patient is on coumadin at home for afib.  On 
admission, his INR was 3.7.  INR rose with administration of 
antibiotics and peaked at 4.9 on [**7-2**].  The patient was reversed 
with vitamin K and 4 units of FFP.  On the floor, he was 
anticoagulated with a heparin drip, stopped for procedures.  His 
platelet count fell from 200 on admission. Heparin was stopped 
on [**2587-7-9**].  Argatroban was started for suspected PE on [**2587-7-10**].

Renal:  The patient's creatinine rose from 0.7 on admission.  
Close attention was paid to fluid status.  The patient had 
hematuria on UA on [**2587-7-4**].  Foley catheter was d/c'd on 
[**2587-7-6**].

Urologic: The patient was discovered to have a paraphimosis on 
[**2587-7-9**].  This was manually reduced by the urology service on 
that day.  On [**2587-7-9**], the paraphimosis recurred, was again 
reduced by urology, and a Foley catheter was inserted.

Nutrition:  The nutrition service was asked to evaluate the 
patient.  The patient received a low-salt, diabetic diet with 
Glycerna supplementation.

Disposition: The patient and his family decided to persue 
comfort measures only as his prognosis with chemotherapy was 
very poor and he had multiple comorbidities. The patient died 
[**2587-7-12**] at 1:47 am.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: 81 year old male with shortness of breath and hypoxia.
     
     Comparison is made to the previous examination of [**2587-5-18**].
     
     TECHNIQUE: Low dose noncontrast images of the chest were performed. Next,
     contrast enhanced images of the chest following rapid bolus administration of
     150 cc of IV contrast were also performed. Images were reconstructed in the
     sagittal and coronal planes. In addition, images through the upper abdomen
     were performed.
     
     IV CONTRAST: Nonionic IV Optiray contrast was used for rapid bolus
     administration.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST: No pulmonary embolism is identified from the
     main pulmonary arterial trunk to the subsegmental pulmonary arterial vessels
     bilaterally. As was previously identified, there is consolidation within the
     posterior aspect of the right upper lobe. However, compared to previous exam
     the degree of dense consolidation has increased and there is more relative
     volume loss. Underlying emphysema is again noted. Compared to the previous
     exam, the right pleural effusion has increased in size, now moderate in size.
     In addition, there is a new left sided pleural effusion, moderate in size, and
     there is associated compressive atelectasis of the left lower lobe. The heart,
     pericardium, and great vessels are stable in appearance. Coronary artery
     calcifications are noted. The major airways and segmental bronchi are patent.
     
     CT OF THE UPPER ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: There is a new posteriorly based
     hypodense renal mass (relative to normal enhancing renal parenchyma) enlarging
     the left kidney which is in smooth continuity with the anterior renal borders.
     In addition, within and anterior to the renal hilum as well as superior to the
     left kidney, there is a large amount of ill- defined mildly enhancing soft
     tissue. There is notable soft tissue infiltration of the mesenteric fat in the
     left upper abdomen, as well as multiple new enlarged retroperitoneal lymph
     nodes in periaortic and aortocaval location. These multiple lymph nodes are
     contiguous with one another in a conglomerated fashion.
     
     The imaged portions of the liver and right kidney are unremarkable. The imaged
     portion of the stomach and bowel loops are unremarkable. The gallbladder is
     normal. Atherosclerotic disease of the imaged portion of the abdominal aorta
     and its major bifurcation is noted. There is no free fluid or focal fluid
     collections.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     (Cont)
     Bone windows demonstrate no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
     
     CORONAL AND SAGITTAL RECONS of the chest: Images reconstructed in the sagittal
     and coronal planes show no pulmonary embolism.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. No pulmonary embolism identified.
     2. Persistent right upper lobe consolidation. The degree of consolidation has
     increased, and there is greater volume loss compared to previous exam. Without
     improvement to antibiotic therapy, this may be related to #5 below. Also, the
     possibility of underlying brnchoalveolar carcinoma should be considered.
     3. Interval increase in right effusion, now moderate in size.
     4. Newly appreciated left pleural effusion with associated compressive
     atelectasis,  also moderate in size.
     5. Soft tissue mass enlarging the posterior aspect of the left kidney, and
     soft tissue infiltrative masses involving the left renal hilum and adjacent
     left kidney. Along with soft tissue infiltration of the mesentery and multiple
     new enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes, the findings are most consistent
     with lymphoma.

     INDICATION:  81 year old man with history of COPD, positive PPD, presents with
     recurrent right upper lobe pneumonia, found to have left perinephric mass on
     chest CT, please evaluate left renal mass and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
     
     COMPARISON:  CTA of the chest [**2587-7-1**], renal ultrasound [**2587-7-1**], and MR of
     the abdomen without and with contrast [**2584-4-4**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     lung bases to the pubic symphysis in the delayed arterial phase.
     
     CONTRAST:  Oral contrast and intravenous non-ionic contrast were administered
     due to patient debility.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  At the lung bases, there are
     bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.  There is consolidation
     vs. compressive atelectasis present at the left lung base.  Within the liver
     are seen multiple small hypodense lesions of different sizes.  The main
     differential diagnosis for these lesions is abscesses vs. metastatic disease.
     There is no intra- or extrahepatic ductal dilatation.  A small degree of
     perihepatic ascites is seen.  The gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, adrenal
     glands are unremarkable.  The right kidney is unremarkable.  From the left
     kidney, there is a large soft-tissue mass extending from the posterior edge.
     The gross measurements of this mass are 52 mm x 32 mm x 70 mm.  Adjacent to
     this mass is extensive retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  There is no
     associated hydronephrosis and the ureters are unremarkable.  The large and
     small bowel are within normal limits.  There is no free air seen.  There is no
     mesenteric lymphadenopathy present.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The rectum, sigmoid colon and
     prostate are unremarkable.  Within the bladder is a Foley catheter.  There is
     no free fluid within the pelvis and no pelvic lymphadenopathy.
     
     Osseous structures show degenerative joint disease in the spine, but no
     suspicious osteolytic or blastic lesions.
     
     There is extensive calcification seen within the aorta and its branches.

     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) Large soft-tissue mass arising from the posterior aspect of the left kidney
     without evidence for hydronephrosis or obstruction.  There is extensive
     adjacent retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  If biopsy is clinically indicated,
     either the mass or the retroperitoneal lymph nodes could be biopsied.
     
     2) Multiple low-attenuation lesions throughout the liver, suspicious for
     metastatic disease or an infectious process causing multiple liver abscesses,
     such as tuberculosis.
     
     3) Left greater than right pleural effusions with associated left-sided
     consolidation within the lungs.  Given these findings, there is concern for a
     systemic process, either infectious such as TB, or neoplastic, such as
     lymphoma, given the many sites involved and the extensive lymphadenopathy.
     Less likely would be a primary lung or renal tumor.
     
     4) Degenerative joint disease in the spine.
     
     5) Extensive aortic calcifications.  These findings were communicated to the
     Medical Team on [**2587-7-2**] at 5:00PM, specifically, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 11123**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10531**] and [**Doctor First Name 12649**]

     consolidation within the lungs.  Given these findings, there is concern for a
     systemic process, either infectious such as TB, or neoplastic, such as
     lymphoma, given the many sites involved and the extensive lymphadenopathy.
     Less likely would be a primary lung or renal tumor.
     
     4) Degenerative joint disease in the spine.
     
     5) Extensive aortic calcifications.  These findings were communicated to the

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: Retroperitoneal mass biopsy.
     
     TECHNIQUE: CT scan of the abdomen was obtained without oral or intravenous
     contrast in the left anterior oblique position using 7-mm collimation.
     
     After the risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient
     via a Cantonese translator, written informed consent was obtained.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: Lung bases once again demonstrate large bilateral
     pleural effusions, as well as bibasilar atelectasis.
     
     The mass within the left posterior pararenal space is once again noted, with
     adenopathy in a para-aortic region. The left kidney is displaced anteriorly by
     the mass effect. The known liver lesions are not well demonstrated due to lack
     of intravenous contrast. Degenerative changes are seen within the spine.
     
     CT-GUIDED NEEDLE LOCALIZATION: Using local anesthesia and sterile technique,
     the site for skin entry was marked.
     
     CT-GUIDED NEEDLE INSERTION: Using CT fluorscopy, a 17-gauge coaxial needle was
     inserted into the left posterior pararenal space at the site of the mass.
     Three 20-gauge fine needle aspirate samples were obtained, and two 18-gauge
     core biopsies were obtained.
     
     The samples were submitted to Cytology, who deemed the samples appropriate.
     Samples were also sent for TB and routine bacterial cultures.
     
     The patient tolerated the procedure well, and no immediate complications were
     encountered.
