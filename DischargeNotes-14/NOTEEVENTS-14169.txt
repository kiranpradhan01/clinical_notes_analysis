Allergies: 
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs
 
Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2891**] 
Chief Complaint:
SOB
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p Thoracentesis on [**1-29**] and [**2-4**]

 
History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 9794**] is an 85yo M w/ a PMH of CHF, CAD, afib, HTN, 
dyslipidemia and PVD who presented to his regularly scheduled EP 
appointment. At his appointment, it was felt that the patient 
had worsened SOB, increased peripheral edema, and what looked 
like a cellulitis vs. thrombophlebitis in his LUE. His radial 
pulse was not palpable and it was felt that the patient needed 
admission for management of his CHF and for vascular surgery's 
evaluation of his LUE.  
.  
The patient and his son note that the patient had been well up 
until 3 months ago when he was first admitted for pneumonia. 
Since that time, it has been a downward spiral and the patient 
has been bouncing in and out of rehab. The son notes that the 
patient never had an issue with fluid management until then and 
was on a steady dose of diuretics for approximately 4 years 
prior to his admission 3 months ago.  
.  
He was most recently discharged from [**Hospital1 19**] on [**2753-1-21**] after a 6 
day stay for CHF exacerbation. It was felt at the time that his 
symptoms were due to miscommunication about his lasix doses (was 
taking 80mg QD instead of 80 QAM/40 QPM). He was aggressively 
diuresed with IV lasix and then switched back to PO lasix. Per 
the son, the patient's left hand was starting to get a little 
swollen prior to discharge.  
.  
Since discharge, the son feels that Mr. [**Known patient lastname 9794**] has steadily 
declined. The rehab has commented on increased abdominal girth, 
swelling in his ""mid section"" (the patient states that his 
scrotum gets pinched by his clothes), as well as worsening 
swelling in his legs and now left arm. He denies any orthopnea 
or PND. Can not assess for DOE as pt is ambulating minimally 
lately. He states that he has only minimal SOB and does not 
require oxygen at the nursing home. However, he does state that 
he sometimes finds it hard to catch his breathe. He denies any 
chest pain or pressure. He denies any LH or dizziness. He denies 
any pain in his left arm and does not think that he had an IV in 
that arm d[**MD Number 278**] his last admission. He states that his arm is 
sensitive to touch, but not frankly painful. Last night, the 
patient notes that he had trouble sleeping but can't tell if it 
was due to shortness of breath or discomfort. He spent the night 
sitting up in a chair and feels like the rehab center just 
wasn't able to take care of him anymore. He feels ""relieved"" 
that he's here.  
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke 
(though son states head CT in past showed evidence of old 
infarcts), TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, 
bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, 
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, 
chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All 
of the other review of systems were negative.  
.  
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, 
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, 
palpitations, syncope or presyncope. Is notable for significant 
edema.

.  
IMAGING:  
EKG [**2753-1-26**] demonstrated ventricular pacing, with fusion beats; 
rate 91; no ST or TW changes.    
.  
[**2753-1-26**] CXR: Moderately large right pleural effusion with 
associated  
atelectasis; right basilar consolidation cannot be excluded.  
.  
[**2753-1-26**] LUE U/S: No evidence of DVT in the left upper extremity. 
 
.  
[**2753-1-29**] CT head: No acute intracranial abnormalities. No 
significant change since [**2751-9-11**] of encephalomalacia of the 
left frontal  
and right parietal lobes and right motor strip. No significant 
change in enlargement of the ventricles.  
.  
[**2753-1-29**] XR LUE:  
1. No definite acute fracture or dislocation.  
2. Severe degenerative changes of the first MCP and first CMC 
joints with prominent subchondral cyst formation. Additional 
erosion of the carpus is also seen, nonspecific.  
3. Unusual appearance of the soft tissues likely reflects an 
external wrap or bandage.  
4. Degenerative change of the acromioclavicular joint with 
adjacent foci of mineralization that may reflect old trauma.  
.
[**2753-1-30**] ART DUPLEX:
Duplex and color Doppler of both inguinal areas demonstrate 
patent common femoral arteries. There is no evidence of graft 
involving either inguinal region. There is a simple fluid 
collection within the right and left inguinal regions noted.
.
[**2753-1-30**] LATERAL DECUB:
Residual moderate right pleural effusion is apparently at least 
partially loculated laterally lower right hemithorax and has an 
intrafissural component as well.
.
[**2753-2-4**] Chest XRay: Large right pleural effusion, which is not 
significantly changed accounting for differences in position. 
There is associated opacity, suggesting atelectasis, although 
underlying pneumonia is not excluded. No significant interval 
change. 
.
[**2753-2-4**] Chest XRay (s/p thoracentesis): Significant interval 
improvement in right pleural effusion consistent with interval 
thoracentesis. Persistent small left pleural effusion and 
pulmonary vascular congestion. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
85yo M w/ PMH of ischemic CM (EF 30%), CAD, DM, HTN, afib and 
PVD, presenting with CHF exacerbation and pleural effusion who 
was also diagnosed with pneumonia, transferred to MICU for 
hypotension possibly from sepsis and then transferred back to 
Cardiology floor once hemodynamically stable.  
.  
# CV  
1) CAD: Pt has known h/o CAD with multiple PCI and interventions 
done in [**2746**]. No evidence of active ischemia during 
hospitalization.  Continue aspirin, beta-blocker was decreased 
from toprol 100 qday to metoprolol 37.5mg bid due to low blood 
pressure.  Continued statin (ACEI held). 
.  
2) RHYTHM: V-paced currently, but irregular. V sensing and 
pacing per interrogation [**1-27**].  Monitored on telemetry throuhout 
hospitalization.  Had been on coumadin as an outpatient.  
Transitioned to heparin for thoracenteses then transitioned back 
to coumadin when INR therapeutic.  INR 2.3 on [**2753-2-9**].
.
3) CHF:  EF 30% on ECHO [**11-23**]. Peripheral edema, though 
intravascularly euvolemic.  
Continued digoxin.  Gently diuresed with prn iv lasix while an 
inpatient.  Switched to lasix 40mg po bid for outpatient regimen 
on [**2-8**].  This dose may need to be adjusted as an outpatient.
.  
# Hypotension/sepsis: Resolved now, s/p MICU stay and briefly on 
dopa though off since [**2-4**]. Prior to MICU pt had fever without 
leukocytosis. All Cx data negative or no growth to date 
including pleural fluid from 2 thoracenteses.  CXR felt to be 
consistent with possible pneumonia and given fever despite 
antibiotics, his antibiotic coverage was broadened to zosyn in 
addition to vancomycin (which was he was already on for possibl 
cellulitis).  Thoracentesis on [**1-29**] and [**2-4**] consistent with 
transudate with cultures no growth to date.  He passed his 
cortisol stimulation test while in the MICU.  Blood pressure was 
stable from [**2-5**] on. 
.  
# Hypoxemia: The patient had hypoxia likely related to both CHF, 
pleural effusion, and pneumonia. He was satting well on 2L NC on 
[**2-8**] and actually satting well (94-95%)on room air on day of 
discharge.  Vancomycin was continued for 12 day course.  Zosyn 
was added on [**2-3**] and to be stopped after 10 day course ([**2-3**] - 
[**2-12**]).  Gently diuresed with prn lasix (as above).  s/p 
thoracentesis on [**1-29**] and [**2-4**].
.  
# ID: The pt had PNA on CXR and on exam has bibasilar crackles. 
Started on Zosyn [**2-3**] (change from levo) and has been on Vanco. 
GPCs on sputum gram stain. Plan for 10 days of Zosyn in addition 
to completed vancomycin course.  CDiff negative.  s/p 2 
thoracenteses as above with evidence of infection/empyema.  
Sputum and urine cultures no growth to date.  
.  
# Anemia: Pt has baseline hct 33, now stable at 31. pt had trace 
guaiac positive stools earlier in admission. Hemolysis labs 
negative.  Hematocrit remained stable.  
.  
# LUE Edema: Improved. Differential initially DVT vs. cellulitis 
vs. thrombophlebitis vs. vascular insufficiency. s/p Vascular 
surgery evaluation and it was felt that it was not arterial 
insufficiency.  Left upper extremity was negative for deep 
venous thrombosis and XRay negative for fracture.  Vascular 
surgery recommended treating with Vancomycin and arm appear 
improved with both antibiotics and ACE bandages.  
.  
# CRI: Baseline Cr is 1.5 and remains at baseline.  Renally 
dosed medications.
.  
# Foot pain: No narcotics as caused mental status changes.  
Continued tylenol and neurontin.
.
# Sundowning: patient was noted to be agitated at night.  His 
[**Doctor Last Name 292**] wake cycle seemed to be off (awake at night and sleeping 
off and on during the day).  Suspect that much of this is due to 
being in the hospital setting.  Started zyprexa 2.5mg po qhs 
prn.  
.  
# R heel ulcer: No evidence of infection. Per vascular imaging, 
has poor perfusion to LE bilaterally.  Wound Care with wet to 
dry dressings daily and aloe vesta applied.  Vascular surgery 
consulted as [**Last Name (un) 10236**].    
.  
# DM: Holding glipizide while inpatient.  Covered with insulin 
sliding scale and monitored finger sticks.
.  
# Access: PICC line (placed [**2-2**]) and in good position and 
working order. 
.  
# PPX: anticoagulated, continued PPI and bowel regimen 
.  
# Code: DNR but can intubate as was discussed with son while 
patient in MICU. (Code status was reversed from DNR/DNI, as 
collaborated with attending) 
.  
# Dispo: to rehab to complete 10 day course of Zosyn (already 
completed vancomycin).  He is to follow-up with cardiologist as 
an outpatient.  His INR was stable on coumadin and should be 
followed as outpatient (INR 2.3 on day of discharge)

     HISTORY:  85-year-old man with anasarca; please evaluate for interval change
     in pleural effusion.
     
     FINDINGS:  Bedside AP examination labels ""upright, 1815h"" is compared with the
     study obtained ten days earlier.  There is a stable moderately large right
     pleural effusion, layering laterally, with associated dense right basilar
     opacity, representsing either compressive atelectasis, focal consolidation, or
     both.  The heart is overall unchanged in size.  No significant pulmonary
     vascular congestion or left pleural effusion is seen.  Left-sided dual-chamber
     cardiac pacemaker with ICD lead has tips projected over the RA and RV apex (in
     this single projection).
     
     IMPRESSION:  Moderately large right pleural effusion with associated
     atelectasis; right basilar consolidation cannot be excluded.

     HISTORY:  85-year-old male with mental status change, status post fall off of
     a toilet, on heparin.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous 5 mm axial images were obtained from the skull base to
     the vertex.
     
     FINDINGS:  There has been no significant change since [**2751-9-11**].  No
     intracranial hemorrhages are seen.
     
     Again seen are areas of encephalomalacia involving the left frontal lobe,
     right parietal lobe, and the right motor cortex, as before.  Again seen is
     minimal amount of cerebral periventricular white matter hypodensities, which
     likely represent small vessel chronic infarcts.  A chronic lacunar infarction
     of the anterior limb of the right internal capsule is again noted.
     
     There is enlargement of the ventricles, as before.
     
     Atherosclerotic calcifications of the internal carotid arteries are seen
     bilaterally.
     
     There are no suspicious bony abnormalities or skull fractures.  Incidental
     note is made of a left-sided nasal septal spur.  There is also an air-fluid
     level of the left maxillary sinus with thickening of the sinus walls, which
     likely represents acute-on-chronic sinusitis changes.
     
     On the scout images, there is minimal anterior spondylolisthesis of C4 on C5,
     which likely is degenerative in origin.  This is unchanged since the prior
     study.
     
     IMPRESSION:  
     
     No acute intracranial abnormalities.
     
     No significant change since [**2751-9-11**] of encephalomalacia of the left frontal
     and right parietal lobes and right motor strip.  No significant change in
     enlargement of the ventricles.

     INDICATION:  Coronary artery disease, CHF, atrial fibrillation, right-sided
     pleural effusion, status post thoracocentesis.  Evaluate for possible
     pneumothorax.
     
     FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with the patient in
     upright sitting position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with a
     similar study dated [**2753-1-26**].  The previously described right-sided
     pleural effusion is practically unchanged in appearance.  It blunts the right-
     sided diaphragmatic contours and pleural sinus completely and reaches up to
     the minor fissure.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax on either right or
     left side.  Previously described cardiomegaly and the presence of a left-sided
     permanent pacer with right atrial and biventricular pacing electrodes is
     unchanged.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumothorax after thoracocentesis.Unchanged
     right-sided pleural effusion.

     INDICATION:  85-year-old man with multiple medical problems, now presenting
     with left upper extremity swelling and tenderness.  Evaluate for fracture.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is an AICD device seen projecting over the left anterior
     chest wall with leads extending into the chest, incompletely evaluated.  There
     is degenerative change of the acromioclavicular joint, with numerous foci of
     mineralization adjacent to AC joint, which may reflect site of old trauma.  No
     acute proximal humeral fracture is seen.  In the wrist, there are numerous
     erosions seen including an erosion of the carpus.  Prominent cyst formation is
     seen at the first MCP and first CMC joints.  Severe degenerative changes are
     seen in these locations as well.  Mineralization is seen adjacent to the
     medial humeral epicondyle which could reflect small intraarticular loose
     bodies versus mineralization in the proximal aspect of the common flexor
     tendon. Osseous irregularity of the lateral humeral epicondyle is also seen.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  No definite acute fracture or dislocation.
     
     2.  Severe degenerative changes of the first MCP and first CMC joints with
     prominent subchondral cyst formation.  Additional erosion of the carpus is
     also seen, nonspecific.

     or bandage.
     
     4.  Degenerative change of the acromioclavicular joint with adjacent foci of
     mineralization that may reflect old trauma.

     PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained on [**2753-2-21**] at 1955 hours and
     compared with the most recent radiograph performed on [**2753-2-5**].  The patient

     COMPARISON:  [**2753-1-29**], demonstrating areas of encephalomalacia involving

     Since prior examination, there has been no significant interval change.  Again
     noted, in the left frontal lobe, right parietal lobe, and right motor cortex
     are areas of encephalomalacia, unchanged when compared to the prior study.
     Unchanged minimal cerebral periventricular white matter hypodensities likely
     represent chronic microvascular infarcts.  Unchanged lacunar infarction in the
     anterior limb of the right internal capsule is seen.
     
     The ventricles appear enlarged and unchanged in configuration. Left maxillary
     sinus fluid level with thickening of the bony sinus walls likely represents
     acute supermiposed upon on chronic sinusitis, and unchanged from prior
     examination. Stable grade 1 degenerative spondylolisthesis of C4 on C5 seen on
     the scout images is again noted.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of pleural effusion.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Unenhanced MDCT of the chest from thoracic inlet to upper abdomen
     was obtained with subsequent 1.25- and 5-mm collimations axial and 5-mm
     coronal reformations reviewed.
     
     COMPARISON:  Serial chest radiographs from [**12-15**] to [**2753-2-23**].
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     Bilateral pleural effusion is small to moderate partially loculated on the
     right and small on the left. No pleural mass or pleural thickening were
     identified on this non- enhanced study.
     
     The airways are patent to the level of segmental bronchi with predominately
     lower lobe bronchial thickening as well as narrowing of the origin of bronchus
     intermedius, right middle and right lower lobe bronchi, suggesting
     bronchomalacia.
     
     Ground glass opacities in the upper lobes most likely represent congestive
     heart failure, also the right lower lobe patchy consolidation might be either
     related to the same process or could represent infection or aspiration.
     
     The heart size is markedly enlarged, involving all 4 [**Doctor Last Name 6997**].  Coronary
     calcification is severe and an LAD stent is present.  Three pacemaker leads
     terminate in the right atrium, right ventricle and a left epicardial vein.
     Mitral valve and aortic annulus calcifications are severe. There is no
     pericardial effusion.
     
     Multiple mediastinal lymph nodes involve all mediastinal stations, ranging up
     to 1.2 cm in subcarinal area and might be related to the longstanding heart
     failure as well as to the longstanding pleural effusion.
     
     Imaged portion of the upper abdomen demonstrates perisplenic fluid, most
     likely representing ascites.  The patient is after cholecystectomy. Low-
     density (16 Hounsfield units), super-5-mm, round lesion in the upper pole of
     the left kidney may represent cortical cyst.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     HISTORY:  85-year-old man with CHF, CAD, DM.  Presenting with right lower
     extremity ulcer.
     
     RADIOLOGIST:  The study was read by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 608**] [**Name (STitle) 609**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Noninvasive evaluation of the arterial system in the lower
     extremities was performed with Doppler signal, pulse volume recording, and
     segmental limb pressure measurements.
     
     FINDINGS:  Doppler signal recording showed monophasic waveforms bilaterally at
     the femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries.
     
     Pulse volume recordings showed symmetrically reduced amplitudes bilaterally. 
     The right ABI was 0.69 and the left ABI was 1.69.  However, the left ABI is
     probably artifactually increased.
     
     COMPARISON:  Compared to the noninvasive arterial study obtained on [**2753-1-30**],
     there appears to be mild progression of disease on the left side.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Moderate bilateral inflow and outflow arterial insufficiency in
     the lower extremities.

     INDICATION:  86-year-old male with aspiration, evaluate for aspiration.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  An oral and pharyngeal swallow video fluoroscopy was performed
     today in collaboration with speech and swallow pathologist.  Thin liquid,
     nectar- thick liquid, and two teaspoons of pureed consistency barium were
     administered.
     
     FINDINGS:  The oral phase was noted for moderate deficits with regard to
     weakened AP tongue movement via the posterior pharyngeal wall during swallow.
     Bolus formation was difficult with moderate oral residue along the tongue and
     base of tongue.  The pharyngeal phase noted for moderate-to-severe deficits
     with regard to decreased hyolaryngeal excursion, bolus propulsion, and
     vallecular greater than piriform sinus residue.  There is mild-to-moderate
     penetration during swallowing of thick liquid due to premature spillover.
     Penetration occurred during the swallow with both thin and nectar-thick
     liquids.  Moderate aspiration occurred during the swallow of both thin and
     thick liquids due to decreased airway closure.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Penetration and aspiration occurred during thin and nectar-thick
     liquids.

     HISTORY:  CHF and pleural effusions, nasogastric tube position.
     
     One portable view.  Comparison with the previous study done [**2753-2-27**].  There is
     continued evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion and a moderate-to-large
     right pleural effusion.  An underlying focal infiltrate in the right lung
     cannot be excluded.  The heart and mediastinal structures are unchanged.  A

     HISTORY:  86-year-old male with chronic right-sided pleural effusion requiring
     several thoracentesis, CHF, and smoking history.  Assess for interval change
     from last week.
     
     Comparison is made to prior CT examination dated [**2753-2-24**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT acquired axial images were obtained through the chest without
     oral or intravenous contrast.  Coronal reformations were evaluated.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There has been marked interval
     progression of right pleural effusion, now large and partially loculated, with
     slight increase in small to moderate-sized left pleural effusion.  There is
     complete collapse of the right lower and right middle lobes due to the
     surrounding effusion with areas of ground glass opacity within the right upper
     lobe and left base, which may represent early atelectasis or
     inflammatory/infectious etiologies.  There is a stable appearance to dense
     coronary artery calcification and slightly prominent mediastinal lymph nodes,
     with artifact from pacemaker leads again identified.  There is also stable
     appearance to cardiomegaly.
     
     Limited examination of the upper abdomen displays stable appearance to small
     amount of perisplenic ascites and a 3 x 3.2 cm left upper pole renal cyst with
     a probable right interpolar right renal cyst.  The patient is again noted to

     CHEST (PORTABLE AP)                                             Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 7009**]
     Reason: Assess if NGT in stomach.                                   
     Admitting Diagnosis: CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE;FAILURE TO THRIVE

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
           86 y.o. male with CHF and pleural effusions, now status post NG tube   NGT 
       may have moved, so will reassess position.           
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Assess if NGT in stomach.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation after nasogastric (NG) tube placement.
     
     TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS:  Portable AP chest radiograph compared to [**2753-2-28**].
     
     The NG tube tip passes below the diaphragm and terminates out of the field of
     view with its sidehole demonstrated within the stomach, thus the tip is either
     in the distal stomach or in the duodenum. The cardiomegaly, the bilateral
     right more than left pleural effusion, the bibasilar atelectasis, the position
     of the right PICC line are unchanged with the tip of the PICC line terminating
     in the mid portion of the superior vena cava.  The left-sided three-lead
     pacemaker terminates in the right atrium, right ventricle, and the left
     epicardial vein. The previous cholecystectomy surgical clips are noted.
