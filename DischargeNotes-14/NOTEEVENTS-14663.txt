Chief Complaint:
Fatigue and dark stool
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD
 
History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 5655**] is a 75 yo M with a history of atrial fibrillation 
(on coumadin), CHF, and metastatic bladder cancer, who presented 
with progressive fatigue over 2 weeks prior to his admission, 
and dark/black stool for one week prior to admission.  He denied 
any other GI symptoms except mild nausea, but no vomiting.  In 
his PCP's office, he was found to have a 12 point Hct drop since 
[**9-28**] and admitted to the MICU for observation.  Of note, his NG 
lavage was clear.  During his MICU stay, his coumadin was 
stopped and he was transfused FFP and Vitamin K.  He also 
received 3units PRBC.  An EGD was performed in the MICU which 
was essentially negative for bleeding or varices, but he was 
noted to have a tortuous esophagus. 
*
On transfer to the floor, his hematocrit was stable (since 
admission), and he had not had further dark stools.  He denied 
CP/SOB, N/V, dizziness, fatigue, or abdominal pain.  
*
Of note, the patient had a previous episode of GI bleeding in 
[**12-27**].  He was treated at [**Hospital6 173**], and at 
that time had an EGD which showed and AVM in the second portion 
of the duodenum.

*
EGD ([**3371-12-6**])
Tortous esophagus consistent with presbyesophagus was noted.  No 
evidence of bleeding noted up to 2nd portion of duodenum. 
Gastroscope could not be advanced beyond this area due to loop 
foprmation in the stoamch. Procedure was repeated with a 
pediatric colonsocope. Due to tortuosity of the stomach, pylorus 
could not be intubated despite multiple attempts, repositioning. 

*
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**3371-12-7**] 9:24 PM
No evidence of failure. Slight improvement from [**12-4**].

 
Brief Hospital Course:
75 year old man with h/o Atrial fib (on coumadin) and metastatic 
bladder cancer, who presented with progressive fatigue and GI 
bleeding (black stool).  
*
1) UPPER GI BLEED -  In the emergency department, an NG lavage 
was performed which was clear.  The patient was admitted to the 
MICU and was given FFP, and Vitamin K because he was on coumadin 
as an outpatient.   He was also given 3 units of PRBCs and an IV 
proton pump inhibitor.  An EGD was also performed in MICU, which 
was essentially negative for bleeding or varices but showed a 
tortuous esophagus.  After stabilizing, the patient was 
transferred to the floor for further observation.  His 
hematocrit remained stable and he had no further episodes of 
melena.  Repeat endoscopy was deferred because the patient's 
hematocrit was stable, and the diagnostic yield from a repeat 
procedure was thought to be low.    
*  
2) ATRIAL FIBRILLATION - Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 5655**] was taken off of his 
coumadin on admission due to his bleeding.  Overall, he was rate 
controlled, but intermittently tacycardic to the 140's.  This 
was thought due to hypovolemia.  He was continued on carvedilol 
and digoxin for rate control.   He was not restarted on his 
coumadin at the time of discharge since this was the patient's 
second GI bleed in the last year while on coumadin. 
*  
3) CAD - The patient had angina briefly in ED with rate related 
ST depressions in the lateral and inferior leads.  The changes 
resolved with IVF volume replacement. He was ruled out with 
three sets of cardiac enzymes.  Serial EKG's were obtained.  His 
aspirin was held due to his GI bleeding.
*
4) CHF - Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 5655**] has a h/o CHF and was given Lasix following 
his transfusion. After he was hemodynamically stable, his 
zestril and coreg were all restarted with conservative hold 
parameters.
*
5) FEN - The patient was maintained on a cardiac diet. 
*
6) CODE STATUS: The patient was DNR/DNI during this admission. 
*

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Congestive heart failure, crackles on exam.
     
     CHEST X-RAY, PORTABLE AP:  Comparison is made to a prior study of [**3369-11-13**].  The heart is enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous.  There is perihilar
     haziness and diffuse interstitial opacities consistent with congestive heart
     failure and interstitial edema.  There is an area of irregular pleural
     thickening at the right lung apex.  Linear opacities are present extending
     from this pleural thickening and there are several bubbly lucencies in this
     region as well.  This finding was seen on the prior chest x-ray.  Interval
     chest CT of [**3370-1-22**] demonstrated scarring with emphysematous change
     in this region.  There is elevation of the left hemidiaphragm which is stable
     in the interval.  The osseous structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Congestive heart failure and interstitial edema.
     2.  Chronic changes as described above.
