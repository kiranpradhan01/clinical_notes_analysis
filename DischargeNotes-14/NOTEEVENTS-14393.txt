Admission Date:  [**2998-3-20**]       Discharge Date:  [**2998-3-28**]

Date of Birth:   [**2938-10-2**]       Sex:  M

Service:  BLUE SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 69-year-old man with a history
of pulmonary embolism and cholangitis, status post ERCP and
stent placement in the common bile duct, was admitted to the
[**Hospital3 708**] for elective ERCP on [**2998-3-14**].  This
ERCP showed no common bile duct stones, and papillotomy was
performed.  The patient subsequently developed nausea and
vomiting, as well as right upper quadrant tenderness on
[**3-20**].  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital6 291**] for evaluation and treatment.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Diabetes mellitus, 2) Renal
insufficiency, 3) Coronary artery disease, 4) History of MI,
5) History of pulmonary embolism, 6) History of
choledocholithiasis, status post common bile duct stent
placement, 7) Status post knee replacement, 8) History of
mitral stenosis, 9) ?History of bronchiectasis.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with his sister, denies
any history of tobacco or alcohol use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Diabetes.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 96.8, pulse 92, blood
pressure 167/78, respiratory rate 18, O2 sat 98%.  The
patient was appropriate for age, pleasant, moderately
jaundiced.  The patient's cardiovascular exam was regular
rate and rhythm.  The patient's lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  The patient's abdomen was soft,
moderately distended, and diffusely tender without rebound
tenderness.  Right upper quadrant was particularly tender
with guarding on examination.  The patient's extremities were
warm.  The patient's rectal exam was guaiac positive.

PERTINENT LAB STUDIES:  The patient's white count was 8,
hematocrit 38.3, platelet 210.  The patient's PT was 15.8,
PTT 30.9, INR 1.7.  The patient's chemistries were within
normal limits.  The patient's ALT was 255, AST 126, LD 277,
alk phos 962, T-bili 3.6, amylase 8, lipase 105.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Blue
Surgery service for management of patient's
cholangitis/cholelithiasis.  The patient was placed on
morphine for pain.  The patient was started on Lopressor to
keep the heart rate under control secondary to patient's
history of myocardial infarction.  The patient was kept NPO.
An NG tube was placed for decompression.  The patient was
started on Pepcid.  The patient was started on vancomycin,
ceftazidime, and Flagyl.  The patient was started on a
heparin drip secondary to the patient's history of pulmonary
embolism, with the goal PTT being between 60-80.

The patient was admitted to ICU for observation.  Serial
abdominal exams were performed.  On [**3-21**], the patient's
abdominal exam gradually improved, with decreased tenderness
in the right upper quadrant.  The patient's liver enzymes
also improved as well, with the total bilirubin being 2.7 and
AST 85.

On [**3-22**], the patient was started on TPN for nutrition.
The patient's abdominal exam continued to improve, with total
bilirubin continuing to trend downward to 1.9.

On the evening of [**3-22**], the patient passed several
maroon stools which were guaiac positive.  The patient's
hematocrit decreased to 23.5.  The patient was determined to
have a lower GI bleed secondary to heparin drip.  The patient
was given 3 units of packed red blood cells.  Heparin drip
was held to prevent further bleed.

Vascular surgery was consulted on [**3-23**], and an IVC
filter was placed for DVT and pulmonary embolism prophylaxis.
The patient was taken off the heparin drip.

On [**3-24**], the patient's exam continued to improve.  The
patient's abdomen was nontender to palpation.  The patient's
hematocrit stabilized to 30, after 3 units of transfusion.

On [**3-25**], the patient was transferred out of the ICU to
the floor.  The patient was advanced to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor First Name **] diet on
[**3-26**].  The patient tolerated the [**Doctor First Name **] diet.

On [**3-27**], the patient was taken off TPN, because the
patient was able to take adequate PO intake.  On [**3-28**],
the patient was stable for discharge.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Home with service.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  1) cefuroxime 500 mg po bid for 2
weeks, 2) NPH Insulin 10 U bid, 3) sucralfate 1 gm po qid, 4)
Lopressor 50 mg po bid, 5) simethicone 40 mg po qid, 6)
Protonix 40 mg po qd, 7) low-sugar metamucil with Citrucel
tid-qid.

FOLLOW-UP PLANNING:  The patient should follow-up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] in one week.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] gave the patient his card.
Please call Dr.[**Doctor Last Name 5528**] office for appointment.  The

     moderate left ventricular enlargement. The pulmonary vessels are unremarkable.
     The lungs appear clear though infilatrate may be present in the left lower
     lobe behind the heart. Some atelectasis is also present at the left base in
     the CP angle. No other acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities identified.
     
     IMPRESSION: Left subclavian line with tip at orifice of SVC. No pneumothorax.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Swollen right leg, history of pulmonary embolus.  Question DVT.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Right lower extremity venous ultrasound is compared to the prior
     study of 2/2003.
     
     FINDINGS:  Assessment of right common femoral vein compressibility was not
     possible due to dressing and plug from recent cardiac catheterization.  The
     right common femoral vein demonstrates normal flow and response to Valsalva
     and augmentation.  The right superficial femoral vein and the popliteal vein
     demonstrate normal flow with augmentation as well as compressibility.  There
     is normal color flow within the right tibial veins.
     
     Limited examination of the left common femoral vein demonstrates normal flow,
     response to Valsalva, and augmentation.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No evidence of right lower extremity DVT.

     PORTABLE AP ERECT VIEWS OF THE CHEST (2 IMAGES):
     
     Comparison is made with prior study performed [**2998-6-22**].  The patient has
     underwent interval median sternotomy and surgical clips and wires are present
     consistent with CABG.  A right IJ central venous line is present with its tip
     in the lower SVC.  There is no pneumothorax.  The heart is enlarged.
     Compared to the prior study there is worsening upper zone redistribution
     consistent with failure.  Bibasilar opacities are present consistent with
     atelectasis.  A rounded opacity within the left lower lateral lung zone has
     developed in the interval worrisome for pneumonia.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Cardiomegaly and worsening failure and bibasilar atelectasis.  Rounded opacity
     at the left base is worrisome for infection.  Follow-up is recommended.
