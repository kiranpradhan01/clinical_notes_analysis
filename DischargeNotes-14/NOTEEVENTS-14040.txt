     consistent with COPD. Again seen is a left apical fat pad. There is a focal
     rounded nodular density within the right lower lobe, consistent with previous
     report of nipple shadow. There is calcification of the aorta and an ectactic
     aorta. There is no focal infiltrate or pleural effusions. No vascular

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 86 year old
male who presented to the Lobby of the [**Hospital Ward Name **] Building
looking for the Emergency Department.  He had been having
chest pain at rest, off and on, for about a week.  He had an
echocardiogram performed the day prior to presentation which
was normal.  On the night of his presentation, he had chest
pain at rest, beginning at approximately 7 p.m.  He was
reluctant to go to the Emergency Room.  He refused when his
wife offered to call 911. His wife ultimately drove him
herself to [**Hospital1 10**] and brought
him to the former site of the Emergency Room on the hospital
east campus. The patient and his wife then presented to the
lobby of the [**Hospital Ward Name **] Building.  The patient was seated in a
wheelchair by security.  An ambulance was called to transfer
him to the west campus and a ""code"" was called as the patient
was having active chest pain.  When the code team arrived on
the scene, the patient was complaining of crushing chest
pain, was pale and diaphoretic, and no blood pressure or
pulse could be measured.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Unknown.

MEDICATIONS:  Unknown.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives with wife.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure immeasurable,
pulseless.  Respirations agonal.  The patient was cool,
clammy, pale.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On the code team's arrival, the patient was
diaphoretic, pale, poorly responsive, pulseless and
hypotensive.  He was laid on the floor and intubated by
anesthesia.  A peripheral intravenous line was inserted.  An
initial electrocardiogram showed what appeared to be a sinus
tachycardia with a somewhat widened QRS and ST elevations
diffusely in the precordial leads and inferior leads.  The
patient was treated as a PEA arrest.  He was given
epinephrine.  CPR was commenced.  He was given epinephrine in
multiple doses intravenously.  He was started on a Dopamine
drip briefly when he regained a pulse.  The pulse was later
lost and CPR was recommenced.  The patient was also given
Atropine, D-50 and insulin, bicarbonate.  The patient was
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit while receiving chest
compressions and bagged ventilation.  The decision was made
not to transfer him to the Emergency Room as he was not felt
to be sufficiently stable to transport.  In the Intensive
Care Unit, the patient continued to be pulseless and without
blood pressure.  Several attempts were made to cannulate his
femoral artery for further intravenous access without
success.  Initial blood gases revealed severe metabolic
acidosis.  After approximately 45 minutes of resuscitation
attempts, resuscitation attempts were halted.  The patient
was pronounced dead at approximately 1 a.m. on [**11-21**]
with the presumed cause of death an inferior myocardial
infarction.  Preliminary results from a post mortem revealed
inferior myocardial infarction with papillary infarction.
