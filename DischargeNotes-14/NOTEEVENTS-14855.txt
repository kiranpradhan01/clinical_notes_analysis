     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      61 year old man with COPD exacerbation, pneumonia, transferred from OSH w/ plan 
      for bronchoscopy in AM. Also has a double lumen line in neck, ? EJ vs IJ. 
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      eval line placement; eval for pneumonia/infiltrates

                                     FINAL REPORT
     PA AND LATERAL CHEST, [**9-2**].
     
     HISTORY:  COPD exacerbation, pneumonia, double lumen line in the neck, please
     identify.
     
     IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to [**3493-12-17**]:
     
     Patient has had right thoracotomy with upper posterior rib resection, marked
     hilar elevation, presumably right upper lobectomy.  Rightward mediastinal
     shift and right apical pleural thickening are stable.  Lungs are markedly
     hyperinflated due to severe emphysema.  Opacification in the axillary portion
     of the left lung is similar in appearance to the previous study, probably
     scarring, but there is new opacification in the right mid lung, probably in
     the middle lobe and in the infrahilar left lower lobe, which could represent a
     small region of pneumonia.  There is no pleural effusion.  Heart size is
     normal.  Evaluation of the central airways, particularly the right main
     bronchus would require CT scanning.
     
     Several segments of catheter project over the right neck and supraclavicular
     region.  As far as I can tell the internal portion of the device ends above
     the right clavicle and the other segments of tubing are external connections. 
     It would help to remove or reposition the external portion of the system for
     any subsequent radiographs.
     
     No pneumothorax.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     
     INDICATION:  61-year-old with severe COPD and recurrent pneumonia, evaluate
     for pneumonia, COPD or masses.
     
     COMPARISONS:  CT chest of [**3493-12-16**].
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial MDCT images through the chest without IV contrast.
     
     CT CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is severe emphysema and fibrotic change.
     Patient is status post right upper lobectomy with residual loculated
     blood/pneumothorax which is not significantly changed from the prior study.
     There are multiple areas of focal scarring within the right lung, none of
     which appear significantly changed.  There are also areas of focal scarring in
     the left lung, however in the left lower lobe, best seen on series 2, image
     29, there is a concerning 8 mm spiculated nodule which is new from the prior
     study and concerning for a new primary lung cancer.  No evidence of pneumonia.
     Study is limited in assessment for lymphadenopathy without contrast but no
     definite enlarged mediastinal nodes are appreciated.  Limited axial scanning
     through the upper abdomen demonstrates a hypodense lesion in the left kidney
     which is not fully characterized, pancreatic calcifications, gallstones, and
     ostomy.  Bone windows demonstrate right chest wall deformity from prior
     surgery and degenerative changes without suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) Severe COPD. No evidence of recurrent/residual pneumonia.
     
     2) New 8mm nodule in the left lower lobe, in a region of prior scar,
     concerning for new primary lung cancer; this could be further evaluated by PET
     CT. Several other areas of apparent focal scarring are also more prominent and
     could be assessed by PET as well.
     
     3) Hypodense lesion in the left kidney, not well characterized on this study.
     
     Findings were discussed after the study with covering night float resident Dr.
     [**First Name (STitle) 1118**].

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1991**] 
Chief Complaint:
productive cough, shortness of breath 
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Placement of PICC line

 
History of Present Illness:
61 y/o male with history of right lung Non Small Cell Cancer, 
s/p right upper lobe lobectomy, severe COPD, and a history of 
MRSA and psuedomanous PNA who presents from ED to ICU with 
hypoxia and possible PNA. He recently had a 3 week 
hospitalization for COPD exacerbation and treated for a 
pneumonia with Bactrim (for MRSA) and levaquin (for 
pseudomonas). He was discharged on [**8-26**] but continued to feel 
SOB and was readmitted several days later where he grew out 
pseudomonas Resistant to ciprofloxacin. Workup also included a 
CXR which showed a question of interstitial process and CTA was 
negative for PE but did reveal bilateral patchy infiltrates in 
middle and lower lobes bilaterally c/w pneumonia. Pt was treated 
with vancomycin and ceftaz during this hospital course, and was 
discharged on prednisone taper. 
. 
He was doing well at home until 1 week PTA when he reports onset 
of fevers to 101, weakness, SOB, pleuritic CP, cough. Denies any 
arm or jaw pain, diaphoresis, nausea, palpitations. ROS + for 
photophobia, dizziness with some balance loss, but no loss of 
consciousness over this time period as well.  
Pt therefore presented to MV hospital. He remained clinically 
stable throughout his course at MVH - afebrile, BP 
110s-130s/60s-70s, HR 60s-80s, RR 18-24 and sats of 93% on 3L -> 
93% on 2L. His pulmonologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]) was contacted and 
recommended transfer to [**Hospital1 19**] for possible bronchoscopy to 
figure out why he is having recurrent COPD flares.  
On arrival here, he states that his breathing feels comfortable. 
 
 
Past Medical History:
1. Non-small cell lung cancer, s/p R upper lobectomy, partial R 
fifth rib resection c/b chronic pain. No chemo or radiation.

Pertinent Labs/Studies:
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**3495-9-28**] 10:10 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. New right middle lung opacification most consistent with 
newly developing pneumonia given acuity of onset (1 month).
2. Underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, status post 
right thoracotomy.
.
[**3495-10-14**]: Portable CXR - 
IMPRESSION: 
Minimal worsening of right pneumonia, superimposed upon severe 
emphysema.  It is difficult to exclude a component of 
necrotizing infection. 
Persistent air collection at right apex, likely due to a 
postoperative 
pneumothorax, unchanged since recent radiograph, but worse when 
compared to older studies from [**3495-8-9**]. 
.
[**3495-10-1**]: Echocardiogram
Conclusions:  
1. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left 
ventricular  
systolic function cannot be reliably assessed.  
2. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The mitral 
valve is not well seen.  
3. There is no obvious vegetations seen, but the cardiac valves 
are not well seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
61 y/o M w/ h/o NSCLC s/p RUL lobectomy, severe COPD, recurrent 
pna over past couple months, with righ sided PNA 
(MRSA/Pseudomonas) and severe hypoxia requiring significant O2 
suppplementation.
.  
1. PNA with Severe Hypoxia: Had right multilobar PNA with 
MRSA/Pseudomonas growing from sputum, with WBC count of 9,000 
and bandemia as high as 22%, elevated anion gap, and elevated 
lactate to 2.4. Also has poor underlying lung function from COPD 
(FEV 1.2L in [**3495-8-9**]) and h/o right upper lobe lobectomy. 
Patient was initially treated with high flow face mask of 15 L 
at 40% with additional NC with saturations varying from 88 to 
98%, but with continued frequent coughing which causes 
desaturations. The patient has since decreased his oxygen 
requirement to Venti amsk at 12 lpm with O2 sats rangin 89 to 
97%. The patient continues to cough and is draining sputum well 
with transition from dark brown thick sputum to thinner 
grey/clear sputum. The patient had one episode small volume 
blood tinged sputum on [**3495-10-14**] attributed to inflammation from 
underlying PNA. The patient is currently being treated with 
Linezolid for a planned 21 day course for MRSA as well as 
Ceftazidime, again for a planned 21 day course for Pseudomonas. 
Amikacin was added for syndergy and to avoid resistance with a 
planned 14 day course (ending dates specified on discharge 
meds). The patient will be discharged with need for  continued 
O2 suppplementation to keep sats >90% and <94% with O2 weaning 
as possible. The patient will continue to require ongoing Chest 
PT and physical therapy as well.
.  
2. COPD: Has h/o COPD on montelukast, spiriva, advair, flovent, 
prednisone 10mg at home with PFT's showing FEV of 1.2 L (42% 
predicted), FEV1/FVC ratio of 42 (59% predicted), 6 L TLC, and 
elevated Residual Volume (193% predicited). He was given Advair, 
Monteleukast, Prednisone 60 mg DAily tapered down to 30 mg Daily 
as well as Atrovent nebulizers. The patient is followed by Dr. 
[**Last Name (STitle) **], his outpatient pulmonolgist with whom he should continue 
to be followed after discharge.
. 
3. Anxiety: Patient was experiencing a significant amount fo 
anxiety during this admission, likely at least partly 
attributable to his air hunger. The patient was maintained on 
Clonopin with hold parameters with Ativan rescues as needed.
. 
4. Acute renal failure: Patient presented with ARF with Cr to 
2.8 which resolved rapidly with fluids down to baseline of 0.7.
.  
5. Chest Pain: Had right sided chest pain, which is diffuse and 
pleuritic, likely due to PNA. Treated with MSSR 45 mg BID and IV 
morphine for breakthrough pain.
.  
6. Abdominal pain: Patient has been experiencing ongoing 
abdominal pain for a few days. A KUB showed a non-obstructive 
bowel gas patterns and the patient's ostomy continues to drain 
well. The patient has good appetite without Nausea/vomiting. C. 
Diff was negative x 1. The patient did have an elevated 
amylase/lipase, now trending down. Pain did not radiate to back 
and again patient was tolerating PO well without any 
exacerbation of pain. The patient's symptoms are exacerbated 
with coughing and are likely secondary to musculoskeletal strain 
from frequent coughing. Treating pain as above with MS SR 45 bid 
with rescue doses.
.
6. Transaminitis: Presented with elevated liver enxymes which 
trended down to normal. Hepatitis panel negative for Hep B or C. 
  
.  
7. H/o LLL nodule and several other areas of focal scarring: 
should be followed with serial CT scans in the future by 
outpatient providers.
.  
8. H/o right upper lobe lung ca: Not active currently. Sputum 
for cytology was negative for malignant cells. No history of 
chemo or radiation.
.  
9. H/o thrush: Likely related to inhaled staeroids. Continued 
his outpt nystatin.  
.
10. Steroid Induced Hyperglycemia: Treated with 70/30 insulin 
BID at AM dose of 40 and PM dose of 22.
.
11. Anemia: Labs consistant with Anemia of chronic disease. Also 
was guaiac positive. Needs to be followed in the future. He is 
s/p colectomy for Ulcerative colitis.
.
12. Ulcerative colitis: S/P colectomy and ileostomy. Not on any 
medications for UC.

     marked amount of opacification of the right middle lung field concerning for
     developing pneumonia.  There are multiple lucencies within this opacity likely
     secondary to underlying emphysematous change.  Heterogeneity is also
     demonstrated bilaterally consistent with underlying emphysematous change.  The
     heart size and mediastinal contours are stable and unremarkable.

     Since the recent radiograph, a left PICC line has been placed, tip in the mid

     consistent with previous partial resection of the right lung.  Superimposed
     upon severe bullous emphysema are multifocal areas of consolidation, most
     pronounced in the right perihilar region.  This area appears minimally
     improved compared to the recent study, but there are worsening areas of
     consolidation in the right lower lobe.  The left lung demonstrates emphysema
     and areas of scarring, but there are no acute areas of consolidation. 
     Right-sided pleural thickening, most prominent at the apex, is without change
     from the baseline radiograph of [**3495-9-2**].

     HISTORY:  COPD and right upper lobe pneumonia, assess for interval change.
     
     FINDINGS:  An upright portable chest radiograph shows unchanged volume loss in
     the right hemithorax with surgical clips at the hilum, old, presumably
     postoperative rib deformities and scarring.  Hyperinflation is seen in the
     right base and left lung, and streaky opacifications in the region of the
     right middle lobe and left lateral upper lobe appear unchanged.  Blunting of
     left costophrenic angle is not seen on [**9-2**] film and appears to
     represent pleural fluid.
     
     CONCLUSION:  Unchanged radiographic appearance of right middle lobe/right base
     and left upper lobe pneumonia and small left pleural effusion compared to
     yesterday's study.

     HISTORY:  COPD and pneumonia.
     
     One portable view done 4 a.m.  Comparison with the previous study done
     [**3495-10-4**].  Lung volumes are decreased.  Patchy consolidation in the right lung
     and a subtle left upper lobe infiltrate persists.  There is evidence of
     underlying emphysema as before.  Surgical clips are projected over the right
     pulmonary hilum.  The heart and mediastinal structures are unchanged.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
         61 year old man with COPD and worsening MRSA and Pseudomonas PNA             
                                    
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      assess interval change

     PORTABLE CHEST [**3495-10-14**]:
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3495-10-11**].
     
     INDICATION:  Pseudomonas pneumonia.
     
     Volume loss in the right hemithorax is slightly worsened.  Heterogeneous areas
     of increased opacity in the right lung are mostly unchanged except for slight
     worsening in the right lower lobe.  Postoperative changes are present in the
     right perihilar region with multiple surgical clips.  An air collection is
     again demonstrated in the right apex, probably representing a postoperative
     pneumothorax as demonstrated on CT of the chest of [**3495-9-2**].  This
     appears larger than at that time but is stable from the recent chest
     radiograph of [**3495-10-11**].  The left lung is overexpanded, and peripheral
     areas of scarring are present most pronounced in the left upper lobe, without
     change.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Minimal worsening of right pneumonia, superimposed upon severe emphysema.  It
     is difficult to exclude a component of necrotizing infection.
     
     Persistent air collection at right apex, likely due to a postoperative
     pneumothorax, unchanged since recent radiograph, but worse when compared to
     older studies from [**3495-8-9**].

     COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, the most recent dated [**3495-10-14**].
     
     PORTABLE RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST:  There has been some interval improvement in
     the degree of heterogeneous increased opacity within the right lung. Post-
     operative changes are again noted in the right perihilar region with multiple
     surgical clips.  Air collection is again identified at the right apex likely
     representing previously noted post-operative pneumothorax.  The size of this
     collection may be slightly larger compared to [**3495-10-9**] secondary to
     increased scarring noted within the right lung.  Over expansion of the left
     lung is again noted, however, no focal consolidation is seen within the left
     lung.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Interval improvement in the degree of heterogeneous opacity
     within the right lung which is superimposed on severe emphysema.  Persistent
     slightly larger air collection at right apex perhaps altered from adjacent
     scarring of prior inflammatory process.

     INDICATION:  62-year-old man with COPD status post right upper lobe resection
     and new right subclavian central venous catheter placement. Evaluate for
     pneumothorax.
     
     COMPARISON:  CT chest dated [**3495-9-2**], PA and lateral chest x-ray dated [**3496-1-6**].
     
     AP AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY:  The patient is status post right subclavian
     central venous catheter placement.  There has been no significant interval
     increase in the well-defined lucent lesion occupying the upper right
     hemithorax The patient is s/p right upper lobectomy, with surgical clips
     adjacent to the right hilum, and this likely represents chronic
     loculated pneumothorax, bounded by marked pleural thickening and
     associated volume loss. There is heterogeneous airspace opacity in the right
     upper lung, with multiple parenchymal bands and architectural distortion in
     the left upper lung, allunchanged. There are no new consolidations or
     effusions. Changes associated with bilateral emphysema are again seen.
     
     IMPRESSION: Stable loculated pneumothorax in the upper right hemithorax,
     likely related to remote right upper lobectomy. If clinically indicated, chest
     CT is recommended for further evaluation.

     INDICATIONS:  62-year-old man with history of emphysema and lung cancer,
     status post right upper lobe resection, with recent pneumonia and pleuritic
     chest pain.
     
     COMPARISONS:  [**3495-9-2**], a chest CT without contrast.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial non-contrast CT images of the chest were first obtained
     without intravenous contrast, followed by a CT angiogram of the chest with
     intravenous contrast.  Sagittal, coronal, and bilateral posterior oblique
     projection reconstructions were also performed.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is a right subclavian
     central venous catheter terminating at the cavoatrial junction.  There are
     multiple small but slightly prominent right hilar and paratracheal lymph
     nodes, all individually less than 10 mm in shortest axis dimension.  These may
     be reactive and are minimally more prominent than on the prior study. There is
     no evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.  The heart, great
     vessels, and pericardium are unremarkable.  There are no pleural or
     pericardial effusions.
     
     Bilaterally, there is severe emphysematous change in both lungs.  The patient
     is also status post right upper lobectomy.  Since [**3495-8-9**], there is
     new partial volume loss in the right lung with slight rightward mediastinal
     shift, with associated diffuse increase in parenchymal density within the
     residual right lung.
     
     Peripherally, there are multiple new patchy opacities which could relate to
     the history of recent pneumonia.
     
     In addition, a large right apical intrapleural air pocket has enlarged
     considerably since the prior study, now measuring up to 10 x 8 cm in axial
     dimensions, compared to only 3.5 x 3.5 cm previously.  This appearance could
     relate either to interval rupture of bullae with increased coalescence into a
                                                                 (Over)

     larger single right apical airspace or to a bronchopleural fistula.  The
     appearance of the left lung is unchanged. Again noted is a 6-mm left lower
     lobe nodule, unchanged.
     
     There are a few subcentimeter unchanged celiac lymph nodes.  There is a tiny
     calcified gallstone, and an unchanged 13-mm hypoattenuating renal cyst in the
     lower pole of the left kidney.  An ostomy is partly visualized in the right
     upper quadrant.  Dense calcification of the pancreatic tail is also unchanged.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.  Deformities
     of multiple right upper ribs are unchanged.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
     
     2.  Increased density and volume loss in the residual right lung, since the
     prior study, as well as new patchy peripheral opacities.  These could
     certainly relate to the history of recent pneumonia.  However, given the
     history of malignancy, three-month followup examination is recommended in
     order to ensure resolution.  The possibility of aspiration could also be
     considered, although the left lung is entirely spared.

     History of respiratory failure with intubation and NG tube placement.
     
     Tip of NG tube is in region of cardia of stomach with sideport in distal
     esophagus and should be further advanced for optimal location.  Tube is
     possibly coiling in the upper esophagus.  No other change since the prior

     HISTORY:  62-year-old man with respiratory failure status post intubation.
     Known severe underlying emphysema.
     
     Comparison is made to prior chest radiograph dated [**3496-1-6**] and CT
     examination from same date.
     
     PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH
     
     FINDINGS:  Again identified is severe architectural distortion and
     hyperlucency over the region of the right apex in this patient known to be
     status post right upper lobectomy with associated right-sided volume loss.
     Slightly increased opacities projecting over the medial right mid and lower
     hemithorax are likely related to abnormal lung architecture and patient
     positioning.  No focal infiltrates are identified and there is no evidence of
     pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.  There has been interval development of a
     small left-sided pleural effusion with accompanying left lower lobe
     atelectasis.  Endotracheal tube is approximately 6 cm from the carina and tip
     of nasogastric tube is noted to terminate prior to the GE junction.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Interval development of small left-sided pleural effusion with adjacent
     lower lobe atelectasis.  No definite focal parenchymal consolidation
     identified.
     2.  Malpositioned nasogastric tube.  Recommend advancement.  Endotracheal tube
     approximately 6 cm from the carina, this may be advanced 1-2 cm for more
     optimal placement as well.
     
     3.  Marked underlying emphysema and volume loss status post right upper
     lobectomy.
     
     Findings discussed with covering physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 527**]. [**Last Name (STitle) 11573**], on date of exam at

     COMPARISON:  Multiple previous radiographs, most recent dated [**3496-4-10**] at
     15:34.
     
     FINDINGS:  ET tube has been repositioned in the interval, and now terminates
     5.7 cm above the carina.  The NG tube still is in a suboptimal positioning
     with the side port well above the expected location of the GE junction.

     loss, opacities projecting over the right medial and lower hemithorax.  There
     is no evidence of pulmonary edema.  Small left-sided pleural effusion and left
     lower lobe atelectasis is unchanged.
     
     IMPRESSION:

Respiratory Care Note
Pt is a 62yo male admitted to OSH for respiratory distress. Pt had been placed on Bipap at OSH, but required intubation this am. Pt transported via MedFlight to [**Hospital1 10**]. Pt is intubated with a #7.5ETT taped at 23cm at lip. Pt placed on AC as noted. BS are coarse and equal. Pt suctioned for moderate amts thick, blood-tinged secretions. IMV rate increased according to ABG's. Initial ABG reveals respiratory acidosis which mildly improves with changes. IMV rate increased accordingly. During CXR, pt developed air leak with volume loss. Cuff deflated on ETT, ETT advanced back to 23. ETT also, moved to L corner of mouth and was retaped - cuff was reinflated with no leak detected. FiO2 weaned and PEEP increased to improve oxygenation. Plan to continue on current settings at this time.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
          62 year old man with COPD respiratory failure worsening hypoxia.            
                
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      PICC placement

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  62-year-old male with COPD and worsening hypoxia.  Please assess
     PICC.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3496-4-12**].
     
     AP UPRIGHT CHEST:  Since the prior study, there has been placement of a left-
     sided PICC with tip extends roughly to the cavoatrial junction.  The actual
     position is difficult to determine given the scarring and patient rotation,
     and therefore pulling back 1.0 to 2.0 cm maybe of value to ensure that the tip
     is in the superior vena cava.
     
     The previously seen perihilar haziness appears to have improved since the
     prior study, and the extensive region scarring and postoperative changes in
     the right upper lobe are unchanged as is underlying severe emphysema.  A 9-mm
     nodule in the left lower lobe appears to have been present on the prior study,
     and appears smaller, but is incompletely evaluated.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     PICC tip appears to be near the cavoatrial junction, but could be pulled back
     1.0 to 2.0 cm to insure tip position in the superior vena cava.
     
     Opacity in the right lower lobe may be a resolving region of infection or
     edema, however PA and lateral chest radiographs when the patient is clinically
     able are recommended to evaluate.
     
     Improved perihilar opacities consistent with improved pulmonary edema.

     CLINICAL INDICATION:  History of right upper lobectomy with pseudomonal
     pneumonia and epigastric pain.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  1.25-mm helically acquired images are obtained from the lung
     apices to the pubic symphysis with intravenous and oral contrast.
     Additionally, unenhanced images of the abdomen and pelvis are acquired.
     Multiplanar reformations are provided for interpretation.
     
     FINDINGS:  Direct comparison is made to prior examination dated [**3496-1-6**].
     
     Again, right upper lobectomy is identified with stable large intrapleural
     airspace at the right upper lung.  Evaluation of lung parenchyma reveals new
     focal opacities within the right lower lobe which is likely secondary to
     infectious etiology.  The left lung remains unchanged, noting severe
     emphysema.
     
     The heart and great vessels are grossly unremarkable. A right IJ catheter is
     seen with its tip in the distal SVC. Scattered subcentimeter lymph nodes are
     noted.
     
     Chunky calcification of the pancreas is again identified, unchanged since
     prior exam.  Liver, spleen, and adrenal glands appear grossly unremarkable.
     Bilateral simple-appearing renal cysts are noted.  Adenomyomatosis involving
     the gallbladder is identified.
     
     The patient is status post colectomy.  Multiple loops of small bowel are noted
     to contact the anterior aspect of the peritoneal cavity, likely secondary to
     adhesions.  The pelvis appears grossly unremarkable, noting numerous post-
     surgical clips.  No lytic or blastic bony lesions are identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  New consolidation is identified at the right lung base, likely
     representing infection.
     
     2.  No acute abnormalities are identified within the abdomen.

     REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of patient with pseudomonas pneumonia.
     
     COMPARISON:  Torso CT from [**3493-7-12**].
     
     PA and lateral upright chest radiograph was reviewed.  The left PICC is
     demonstrated with the catheter terminating at the junction of brachiocephalic
     vein and SVC and a wire is demonstrated below this with tip terminating 2.5 cm
     distally to the end of the catheter.  The right mediastinal shift is
     unchanged.  There is significant bilateral distortion of the lung parenchyma
     with severe emphysema, bullous, at the both apices, right more than left, but
     involving the entire lungs.  Slight improvement in the aeration of the right
     lower lobe infrahilar area is demonstrated as well as decrease in left pleural
     effusion and improved aeration of the left lower lobe.
     
     The surgical clips at the level of the right hilus as well as elevated right
     hemidiaphragm suggest previous surgery, most likely right upper lobectomy.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Severe emphysema with bullae predominantly affecting the right lung, but
     also extremely pronounced on the left.  Overall slight improvement of
     bilateral consolidations.
     2.  Tip of the PICC introducer wire terminates 2.5 cm distal to the catheter,
     in the mid SVC.
     3.  Evidence of previous surgery, most likely right upper lobe lobectomy.

Tx'd to micu.  

Events of overnight:

Micu course involved increasing anxiety.  Pt was apparently refusing nebs and did not bipap (during first few hours of arriving on dayshift) but did electively want to be intubated. At shift change, pt was working very hard to breathe with rr up to 40, diaphoretic, desatting to 80's, tachycardic to 140. Given 4mg dilaudid.  Resident, attending and pulm fellow at bedside-decision to intubate.  Anesth notified and intubated without event with succs/etomidate and immed after given 10mg dilt to treat HR of 160.  Placed on fent/vers gtts.  (pt expressed large concern over being awake while intubated prior to procedure).  Anesth verbalized that pt had significant matter in airway-? food aspiration. 

NEURO: sedate on fent at 25mcg/hr (initially on 25mcg/hr-pt with very uncomfortable breathing pattern-appeared like [**Last Name (un) **] stoking) increased to 100mcg/hr but decreased once more comfortable appearing.  Was alert and oriented prior to intubation and able to follow commands.  now not following commands. Only withdraws to noctious stimuli.  pearl/sluggish 2mm.
