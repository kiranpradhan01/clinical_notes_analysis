Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3794**] 
Chief Complaint:
SOB/hypoxia 
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None
 
History of Present Illness:
98F NH resident with h/o CAD, CHF, ppm (non-functioning) who 
presents with acute SOB from [**Hospital **] Rehab. The family states 
that the SOB started soon after she was fed. She was noted 6pm 
to become acutely SOB with hyoxia to 80s, with bp 210/110, HR 
130s, t 99.8. She was given atrovent, nitro paste with bp to 
170/100 sats improved to 95% on NC. Per [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] fellow note at 
the NH, th patient was DNR/DNI at the nursing home, so there was 
initial reluntance to send the pt to the ED, altough ultimately 
an ambulance was called. Per ED staff, the DNR status was 
reversed in ED. Ambulance arrived, pt was placed on NRB, noted 
to be wheezy.  
In ED, initial vitals were 200/86 p 130 rr 30s 83% RA. Pt was in 
apparent respiratory distress and was placed on BiPAP. She 
transiently had bp to 80s which quickly came up to 100s when she 
was taken off Bipap and given 1L IVF. She recieved 
vanc/ctx/azithro for possible PNA (she had WBC to 29.4). There 
was initial concern for ICU admission. She was evaluated in the 
ED by ICU attending in whose assessment the SOB was of unclear 
etiology. Diagnostic possibilities included aspiration, CHF, 
less likely sepsis given the clinical improvement. CTA was 
negative for PE, though showed, Bilateral moderate pleural 
effusions. CT abd was done for abd pain and showed no acute 
process. The patient stabilized from a respiratory standpoint 
and was admitted to medicine. She arrived on the floor in stable 
condition satting 100% on 4L

Discharge Labs:
WBC 9.3, Hct 37.0, Plt 436 
.
Imaging:
CTA:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of thoracic aortic dissection or pulmonary 
embolism.
2. Atherosclerotic change of the thoracic aorta, with ulcerated 
plaques.
3. Coronary artery, aortic, aortic valve and mitral valve 
calcifications.
4. Bilateral moderate pleural effusions, right greater than 
left, simple in nature.
5. Appearance of the trachea during respiratory motion raises 
the possibility of tracheomalacia. If this is of clinical 
concern, a dedicated tracheal CT study could be performed.
6. 2 mm subpleural nodular opacity of the right upper lobe. In 
the absence of risk factors for lung cancer, no followup is 
needed. If risk factors are present, one-year CT followup could 
be obtained.
7. Compression deformity of the lower thoracic vertebral body, 
with near complete collapse seen anteriorly, acuity 
indeterminate.
.
CT Abd/Pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. No definite acute inflammatory pathology is identified within 
the abdomen or pelvis to account for the patient's symptoms. 
Mildly limited exam, as additional IV contrast was not 
administered for the exam.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
3. Sigmoid diverticulosis, without definite CT evidence of 
diverticulitis.
4. T12 and L1 compression fractures, acuity indeterminant.
.
CXR:
FINDINGS: Single frontal view of the chest was obtained without 
prior study available for comparison. The heart size and 
cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits. There is a 
dual-lead pacemaker on the left. There are low inspiratory lung 
volumes. There are small bilateral pleural effusions and 
probable associated mild basilar atelectasis. No definite focal 
airspace consolidation is identified. The bones are 
demineralized.

IMPRESSION: Low inspiratory volumes, small bilateral pleural 
effusions, and mild bibasilar atelectasis
.
ECHO:
Conclusions:  
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses are  
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Tissue 
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling 
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free 
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately 
thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is 
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There 
is a small pericardial effusion.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
98F NH resident with h/o CAD, CHF, ppm (non-functioning) who 
presents with acute SOB.  Her hospital course is as follows:
.  
Shortness of breath:  Pt arrived to the ED in respiratory 
distress and hypertensive.  She was stabilized on BiPAP briefly, 
but her BP dropped and she was put on nasal cannula.  ABG showed 
good oxygenation and ventilation.  CTA ruled out PE or other 
acute processes, though she did have moderate bilateral pleural 
effusions.  It was thought that the patient may have aspirated 
or had pulmonary edema.  Her WBC was 29 but repeat was 9.  
Lactate was 2.1.  She was afebrile.  Blood/urine cultures were 
went.  Sepsis was at a low likelihood.  She arrived on the floor 
stabile.  We titrated her off of 02.  Speech and swallow 
recommended pureed diet with nectar pre-thickened liquids.  She 
was given 1 unit of PRBCs.  [**4-5**] into her unit, she developed 
agitation and mild hypoxia, as well as hypertension to 230 
systolic.  With suspicion for edema, she was given lasix and 
diuresed well.  She returned to her baseline oxygenation.  She 
was also given nitropaste and her BP improved.  Her antibiotics 
were swtiched to include only levo/flagyl to cover for possible 
aspiration pneumonia.  Her symptoms were thought likely 
aspiration pneumonitis vs mild fluid overload.  ECHO showed 
elevated PCWP, but no other abnormality.  She is VERY sensitive 
to fluid shifts, and any fluids must be given with great care, 
and blood products should be followed by diuresis.  Her 
antibiotics were D/Cd on discharge.  Can consider gentle 
diuretics at home, and monitor fluid status closely.
.  
Cardiac Enzymes:  On admission, her troponin was found to  be 
elevated, with a negative CK/MB.  Her EKG showed some TWIs in 
the setting of her HTN, tachycardia.  This was felt to be demand 
ischemia, especially given her anemia.  We trended her enzymes 
which peaked at 0.23 but trended down thereafter.  We gave her 2 
units PRBCs as per above.  She remained chest pain free 
thereafter.
.  
Anemia: Her Hct was went from 32 - >25 -> 37.  She did not have 
any active signs of bleeding.  Her imaging was negative for 
bleed.  She was hemodynamically stable.  to support her, we gave 
her 2 units PRBCs.  She required diruesis with her units as she 
was very sensitive to these fluid shifts.
.  
FEN: Speech and swallow recommended pureed foods with nectar 
pre-thickened liquids.  She is to eat upright, have her pills 
crushed in applesauce.  Please see attached nutrition/speech 
consult

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Respiratory distress and tachycardia with right bundle branch
     block.  Evaluate for PE.
     
     There are no prior studies for comparison.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images through the chest were obtained before and
     after the intravenous administration of 90 cc of IV Optiray.  Coronal,
     sagittal, and oblique reformatted images were generated.
     
     CTA OF THE CHEST:  There is no evidence of thoracic aortic dissection.  There
     are marked atherosclerotic changes of the thoracic aorta, with several
     ulcerated plaques seen.  There are no filling defects within the pulmonary
     arterial branches to suggest a pulmonary embolism.  There are coarse
     calcifications of the mitral valves, and to a lesser degree of the aortic
     valve.  There are also coronary artery calcifications.  There is no
     pericardial effusion.  There are bilateral pleural effusions, moderate, right
     greater than left.  The effusions are simple in nature.  A pacemaker is seen
     within the left chest, with leads of the right atrium and right ventricle.
     There is a subpleural 2 mm nodular opacity within the right upper lobe (series
     3, image 27).  No other definite nodules are visualized.  There are no
     consolidations within the lungs, and there is no definite failure.  Bilateral
     dependent atelectasis is seen adjacent to the effusions.  The airways are
     patent to the subsegmental level bilaterally.  However, as the patient is
     breathing through the image acquisition, at least some degree of tracheal
     collapse is seen, raising the possibility of tracheomalacia.  This possibility
     is perhaps best seen on series 3, image 30.  A borderline lymph node is seen
                                                                 (Over)

     within the right hilum, measuring 11 mm in the short axis.  There are other
     small lymph nodes within the mediastinum that do not meet CT size criteria for
     pathologic enlargement.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Diffuse abdominal pain.  Evaluate for obstruction or abscess.
     
     There are no prior studies for comparison.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images through the abdomen and pelvis were
     obtained following the administration of oral contrast only.  Since IV
     contrast was administered earlier today for a chest CT, additional IV contrast
     was not administered.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were generated.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  Moderate pleural effusions are again seen at
     the lung bases.  Evaluation of the solid organs is limited without concurrent
     use of IV contrast, but the non-contrast enhanced appearance of the liver,
     spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands is unremarkable.  Contrast continues to
     be excreted from both kidneys, which show no hydronephrosis.  There is mild
     stranding about both kidneys, which is a nonspecific finding.  This stomach,
     small and large bowels are normal.  There is no free air or free fluid in the
     abdomen.  No pathologically enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph
     nodes.  There is atherosclerosis of the abdominal aorta, which is normal in
     caliber.  Calcified sutures are seen within the anterior abdominal wall.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  There is sigmoid diverticulosis, without
     definite evidence of diverticulitis.  There is a Foley catheter within the
     bladder.  The uterus and adnexa are not visualized, and may have been removed.
     No pathologically enlarged pelvic or inguinal lymph nodes.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  The bones are demineralized.  A left total hip replacement is
     present.  No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are seen.

      No definite acute pathology seen. Limited exam as additional IV contrast could
      not be administered. Sigmoid diverticulosis without diverticulitis. T12 and L1
      compression fractures, acuity indeterminate.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Diffuse abdominal pain.  Evaluate for obstruction or abscess.
     
     There are no prior studies for comparison.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images through the abdomen and pelvis were
     obtained following the administration of oral contrast only.  Since IV
     contrast was administered earlier today for a chest CT, additional IV contrast
     was not administered.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were generated.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  Moderate pleural effusions are again seen at
     the lung bases.  Evaluation of the solid organs is limited without concurrent
     use of IV contrast, but the non-contrast enhanced appearance of the liver,
     spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands is unremarkable.  Contrast continues to
     be excreted from both kidneys, which show no hydronephrosis.  There is mild
     stranding about both kidneys, which is a nonspecific finding.  This stomach,
     small and large bowels are normal.  There is no free air or free fluid in the
     abdomen.  No pathologically enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph
     nodes.  There is atherosclerosis of the abdominal aorta, which is normal in
     caliber.  Calcified sutures are seen within the anterior abdominal wall.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  There is sigmoid diverticulosis, without
     definite evidence of diverticulitis.  There is a Foley catheter within the
     bladder.  The uterus and adnexa are not visualized, and may have been removed.
     No pathologically enlarged pelvic or inguinal lymph nodes.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  The bones are demineralized.  A left total hip replacement is
     present.  No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are seen.
     
     Multiplanar reformatted images were essential in delineating the anatomy and
     pathology in this case.  The near complete collapse of the T12 vertebral body
     is again seen, and anterior compression of the L1 vertebral body is also seen.

     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images through the abdomen and pelvis were
     obtained following the administration of oral and 130 cc of Optiray contrast
     IV.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were generated.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  There are moderate pleural effusions again
     seen at the lung bases, unchanged.  There is mild associated atelectasis.
     There are mitral valve calcifications, coronary calcifications, and a
     pacemaker in place.  The liver, spleen, pancreas, and left adrenal gland are
     unremarkable.  There is very miniscule nodularity to the inferior aspect of
     the right adrenal, without a definite lesion seen.  The common bile duct
     measures up to about 10 mm and tapers normally, within normal limits for a
     near centenarian.  The kidneys enhance and excrete symmetrically.  The
     stomach, small and large bowel are normal.  There is no free air or free fluid
     in the abdomen. No pathologically enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph
     nodes. The aorta is of normal caliber, with atherosclerotic calcification. The
     proximal celiac, SMA, and [**Female First Name (un) **] are patent.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  There is a left total hip replacement, with
     artifact obscuring detail.  There is sigmoid diverticulosis, without definite
     evidence of diverticulitis. However, there is apparent thickening of the wall
     of the sigmoid over several centimeters, which could be related to
     nondistention though a mass at this locale cannot be excluded. The uterus and
     adnexa are again not visualized and may be surgically absent. There is no free
     fluid in the pelvis, and no pathologically enlarged pelvic or inguinal lymph
     nodes.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  The bones are demineralized.  Compression fractures of T12 and
     L1 appear similar.

     1.  No definite acute inflammatory pathology is identified within the abdomen
     or pelvis to account for the patient's symptoms.

     centimeters. While the appearance may be due to nondistention, a mass at this
     locale cannot be excluded. Correlation with sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy
     recommended.
