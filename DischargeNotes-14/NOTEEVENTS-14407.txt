     HISTORY:  84-year-old female after endotracheal tube placement.
     
     COMPARISON:  No prior study available.
     
     FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates endotracheal tube in
     low position with tip at the carina.  It is suggested that this be pulled back
     approximately 2-3 cm.  The heart is moderately enlarged in size.
     Calcifications are noted of the aortic arch.  The lung parenchyma is clear.
     There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  ET tube in low position.  It is suggested this be pulled back
     2 to 3 cm.
     2.  Cardiomegaly.
     
     These findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4832**] at 7 p.m., [**3244-2-18**].

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      84 year old woman with L MCA stroke and L MCA clot on CTA.                      
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      use of MERCI device for clot removal                                            
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Acute left MCA stroke.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Under general anesthesia, the patient's right groin was prepped
     and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 5 Fr arterial sheath was
     introduced into the right common femoral artery and followed by a 4 Fr
     Berenstein II guide catheter which was used for cerebral angiography.  Under
     fluoroscopic guidance, the catheter was navigated to the left internal carotid
     artery, where angiography was performed in the frontal and lateral planes.
     Based on the diagnostic findings, it was decided to proceed with intervention.
     Using an exchange length guidewire, the catheter and arterial sheath were
     removed and replaced by a 9 Fr Merci clot removal device which was advanced to
     the proximal left internal carotid artery.  A 14X microcatheter was navigated
     to the left middle cerebral artery and the X6 Merci device was deployed within
     the left middle cerebral artery, with attempt at clot removal. Three passes
     were made in attempt to remove the left middle cerebral artery thrombus.
     Following removal of the Merci device, the guide catheter was replaced by a 9
     Fr arterial sheath, which was sutured in place in the right groin.  The
     patient was transferred, intubated to the recovery room, at her neurologic
     baseline. There were no apparent complications.
     
     TASKS:
     
     1. Catheterization of the right common femoral artery.
     
     2. Catheterization of the left internal carotid artery.
     
     3. Superselective catheterization of the left middle cerebral artery.
     
     4. Deployment of the Merci device in the left middle cerebral artery, with
     attempted clot extraction.
     
     5. Control angiography via the left internal carotid artery.

     (Cont)
     Injection of the left internal carotid artery revealed an abrupt cut-off of
     the contrast column in the mid M1 arterial segment on the left, consistent
     with occlusion by an acute thrombus.  Runoff in the anterior cerebral artery
     candelabra was unremarkable.  Multiple attempts at clot extraction via
     deployment of the Merci device in the distal M1 arterial segment were
     unsuccessful and control angiography revealed continued presence of occlusion
     of the M1 segment.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Unsuccesful attempt at extraction of a left MCA thrombus using
     the Merci device.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      84 year old woman with L MCA stroke and L MCA clot on CTA.                      
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      use of MERCI device for clot removal                                            
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Acute left MCA stroke.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Under general anesthesia, the patient's right groin was prepped
     and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 5 Fr arterial sheath was
     introduced into the right common femoral artery and followed by a 4 Fr
     Berenstein II guide catheter which was used for cerebral angiography.  Under
     fluoroscopic guidance, the catheter was navigated to the left internal carotid
     artery, where angiography was performed in the frontal and lateral planes.
     Based on the diagnostic findings, it was decided to proceed with intervention.
     Using an exchange length guidewire, the catheter and arterial sheath were
     removed and replaced by a 9 Fr Merci clot removal device which was advanced to
     the proximal left internal carotid artery.  A 14X microcatheter was navigated
     to the left middle cerebral artery and the X6 Merci device was deployed within
     the left middle cerebral artery, with attempt at clot removal. Three passes
     were made in attempt to remove the left middle cerebral artery thrombus.
     Following removal of the Merci device, the guide catheter was replaced by a 9
     Fr arterial sheath, which was sutured in place in the right groin.  The
     patient was transferred, intubated to the recovery room, at her neurologic
     baseline. There were no apparent complications.
     
     TASKS:
     
     1. Catheterization of the right common femoral artery.
     
     2. Catheterization of the left internal carotid artery.
     
     3. Superselective catheterization of the left middle cerebral artery.
     
     4. Deployment of the Merci device in the left middle cerebral artery, with
     attempted clot extraction.
     
     5. Control angiography via the left internal carotid artery.

     (Cont)
     Injection of the left internal carotid artery revealed an abrupt cut-off of
     the contrast column in the mid M1 arterial segment on the left, consistent
     with occlusion by an acute thrombus.  Runoff in the anterior cerebral artery
     candelabra was unremarkable.  Multiple attempts at clot extraction via
     deployment of the Merci device in the distal M1 arterial segment were
     unsuccessful and control angiography revealed continued presence of occlusion
     of the M1 segment.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Unsuccesful attempt at extraction of a left MCA thrombus using
     the Merci device.

     (Cont)
     CT ANGIOGRAM OF THE HEAD AND NECK:  There is possible anomalous origin of left
     common carotid artery from the innominate artery, more commonly known as the
     bovine arch.  However, this is not completely evaluated on the present study. 
     Atherosclerotic calcification is not involving the aortic arch, origins of the
     left common carotid, left subclavian arteries.  Atherosclerotic calcification
     is also noted at the right common carotid artery bifurcation as well as on the
     left common carotid artery bifurcation.  However, no flow-limiting stenosis is
     noted.  Bilateral intracranial carotid arteries, right ACA, MCA and left ACA
     were patent and normal in caliber.  There is occlusion of the left MCA, distal
     to the origin of the anterior temporal branch with nonvisualization of the
     distal branches.  Bilateral vertebral arteries, basilar artery, left PCA were
     patent.  The right vertebral artery is hypoplastic.  The right P1 segment of
     the PCA is not visualized and is there is a fetal PCA on the right side.
     
     CT PERFUSION:  There is a large area of decreased blood flow and blood volume
     with increased mean transit time in the left MCA territory, involving
     predominantly the medial aspect of the left temporal lobe, consistent with
     infarct core.  Lateral and posterior part of the left temporal lobe has
     increased mean transit time with increased blood volume, corresponding to
     ischemia, but not necessarily infarction.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Left MCA embolic occlusion, distal to the origin of the anterior temporal
     branch, with large infarct core, predominantly involving the medial temporal
     lobe and an ischemic area involving the lateral and posterior portions of the
     left temporal lobe.

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      hemorrhage? interval change?

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  84-year-old female status post left MCA stroke.  Evaluate for
     interval change.
     
     COMPARISON:  Non-contrast head CT dated [**3244-2-19**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Routine non-contrast head CT.
     
     FINDINGS:  High-density material within the left caudate head and left basal
     ganglia appears slightly decreased in density and may represent
     petecheal hemorhage.  Edema within the left frontoparietal region is
     consistent with evolving left MCA territory infarction.  Mass effect on the
     anterior [**Doctor Last Name 67**] of the left lateral ventricle, body of the lateral ventricle,
     and third ventricle is slightly increased from one-day earlier.  At the level
     of the septum pellucidum, there is a minimal increase in left to right
     subfalcine herniation.  There is no evidence to suggest uncal herniation.  No
     new intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage is identified.  The appearance of the
     brain and adjacent soft tissues is otherwise unchanged.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Evolution of left MCA territory infarction with minimally
     increased mass effect and left to right shift of normally midline structures
     as described above.  Increased density in the left caudate head and basal
     ganglia may suggest petecheal hemorrhage within infarct.  
     Findings discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7250**] at 1:38 pm on [**3244-2-20**].

Neuro exam done off propofol Q2hrs.  No changes in assessment throughout the day - pt. continues to withdraw to nailbed pressure in all extremeties, but does rotate right wrist inward as she withdraws.  Pt. has not opened eyes or followed commands today.  Right pupil larger than left, from very slightly to 1mm.  Head CT repeated without change.  Mannitol added to regimen for cerebral edema.

After a family meeting with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 240**] this morning, the decision was made to extubate pt. after head CT.  The plan is to continue current treatment (though pt. DNR/I) unless pt. began to struggle with her breathing, or appear to have pain.  At which time a morphine gtt would be started and pt. would be CMO.  This would be at nursing and family's discretion.

Pt. extubated at 1615 without incident.  She has since been hyperdynamic, treated with labetolol and hydralazine.  When no effects noted by SBP in 180's, HR 100, along with ongoing tachypnea in mid 30's with accessory use, 2mg morphine/hr started at this writer's and pt's son's discression.  Vital signs and respiratory assessment have since stabilized (after approximately 45mins.)  No signs of discomfort noted.  Nueromed. resident updated with these findings.

Pt. on 70% face tent.  Prior to morphine gtt, she required frequent subglottal suctioning for copious secretions.  Presently resp's easy, LS less rhonchorous, but remain coarse.

Abd. soft.  NGT left in for any PO meds, as pt. continues to be treated medically.

UO as doc, brisk output following mannitol.

Family in this a.m.  Priest in for SOS at noontime.  Son returned this afternoon and left at 1800.

PLAN:
Continue to communicate with family regarding pt's assessment, especially comfort.
To be discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1707**].
Pt. is DNR/DNI.
