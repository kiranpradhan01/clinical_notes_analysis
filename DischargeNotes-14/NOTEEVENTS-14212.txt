Admission Date:  [**2966-7-14**]       Discharge Date:  [**2966-8-7**]

Date of Birth:   [**2894-2-9**]       Sex:  F

Service:  .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 72 year old woman with
a history of a cerebrovascular accident with left hemiparesis
who fell down at home and was found at the bottom of an 11
foot staircase unresponsive at the scene.  When EMS arrived,
she was not moving.  She was intubated at the scene and had a
collar placed on and was transported to [**Hospital1 1205**] on a board, unresponsive, with a cervical
collar placed on [**2966-7-14**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Multiple cerebrovascular accidents.
2.  Left hemiparesis.
3.  Diabetes mellitus.
4.  Hypertension.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Unknown.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aggrenox.
2.  Aspirin.
3.  Glucotrol.
4.  Prevacid.
5.  Zestril.
6.  Acebutolol.
7.  Celexa.

ALLERGIES:   She has allergies to intravenous dye.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her physical examination upon
presentation was temperature of 94.7 F.; pulse of 88 with a
blood pressure of 203/64.  She was [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 788**] Coma Score of
8-2, non-responsive, opened her eyes at times.  Moved her
arms non-purposely.  HEENT:  Pupils were 3 mm and reactive.
The tympanic membranes were intact.  Her trachea was midline.
 Her heart was a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1,
S2. Her chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally without
crepitations, without obvious deformities.  Her abdomen was
soft and flat with decreased bowel sounds.  Extremities had
four plus distal pulses without deformity.  Her back had no
stepoff, no crepitations.  Rectal tone was normal.  She was
guaiac negative.

LABORATORY:  On presentation, white blood cell count of 20.1,
hematocrit of 30.0, platelets of 241.  Sodium of 133,
potassium 3.9, chloride 98, BUN of 26, creatinine of 0.9,
calcium of 1.1, lactate 1.5.  Her initial arterial blood gas
upon presentation was pH of 7.3 with a pCO2 of 42, pO2 of
259, bicarbonate of 30 and a base deficit of 3.

She had a head CT scan which revealed a right sided subdural
hematoma as well as a right frontotemporal intraparenchymal
hemorrhage.

Her chest CT scan showed a right small pneumothorax.
Abdominal and pelvic CT scan was negative.  Her neck CT scan
was consistent with degenerative changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Surgical
Intensive Care Unit.  Neurosurgery was consulted for the
intraparenchymal hemorrhage as well as the subdural hematoma.
Neurosurgery came and evaluated the patient and decided that
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] bolt was necessary to monitor the patient's cranial
pressure.  The [**Last Name (un) **] bolt was placed without difficulty.

The patient remained in the Intensive Care Unit with
aggressive monitoring for her increased intracranial pressure
as well as her hemodynamic status.  She was intubated and
sedated in the Intensive Care Unit for several days while
responding to therapy.  The patient was extubated on [**7-20**],
without difficulty.  Early in the morning on [**7-21**], the
patient produced copious amounts of secretions and it was
necessary to be re-intubated for protection of her airway.

Subsequently, the lateral cervical spine films revealed a C2
fracture.  The patient had remained in the cervical collar
during her hospital duration due to the fact of being unable
to clinically clear her cervical spine.  Neurosurgery
commented on the fact that the patient has a C2 fracture and
that she should remain in a hard cervical collar for eight
weeks.  Following that re-intubation, the patient was again
stabilized in the Intensive Care Unit and was sedated while
intubated.

She was then extubated subsequently and was found to be
stable for transfer to the floor.  Prior to transfer to the
floor, she had an IVC filter placed for pulmonary embolism
prophylaxis.  While on the Floor, the patient had a modified
barium swallow which revealed a total swallow failure.

Interventional Radiology was asked to place percutaneous GJ
tube.  The patient had the GJ tube placed on Monday, the 8th.
She has been tolerating her tube feeds without difficulty.
She has been seen and evaluated by Physical Therapy who
recommended her for inpatient rehabilitation.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:   The patient's status at discharge
is stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Bilateral subdural hematomas with a frontotemporal
intraparenchymal bleed.
2.  C2 fracture.  She is to remain in a Cervical Collar for a
total duration of eight weeks.
3.  Status post IVC filter placed.
4.  Status post GJ feeding tube placement.

DISCHARGE STATUS:   Upon discharge, her physical examination
revealed the patient who was afebrile; her vital signs were
stable.  She had no complaints today.  Her tube feeds were at
goal.  Her chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.  She
was soft, nontender, nondistended.  Her neurologic status
remained unchanged.

She was deemed stable for transfer to the rehabilitation
center as soon as a bed could be obtained.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  The patient is to follow-up with the Trauma Surgery
Clinic in two to three weeks.
2.  She is to follow-up with Neurosurgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 976**], in
four weeks.
3.  She is to remain in her cervical collar for a combined
total of eight weeks; she has been hospitalized for 22 days
at this time.  She is to remain in her collar for another
five weeks upon discharge.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Acebutolol 400 mg p.o. q. day.
2.  Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q. day.
3.  Amiodarone 200 mg q. day which is to be started on
[**2966-8-7**].
4.  Insulin sliding scale, see attached sheet.
5.  Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q. day.
6.  Albuterol nebulized q. two hours p.r.n.

     CT OF THE CERVICAL SPINE DATED [**2966-7-14**].
     
     INDICATION:  Fall.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiple axial images of the cervical spine were obtained without
     intravenous contrast and reformatted in coronal and sagittal projections.
     
     CT OF THE CERVICAL SPINE WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  C1 through the upper
     portion of T2 are visualized.  No prevertebral soft-tissue swelling is seen.
     There is irregularity of the superior articular surface of C-2 on the left>
     This could represent old trauma but acute fracture is a distinct possibility.
     Multiple level osteophytic degeneration is seen, centered around C4 through
     C6.  Loss of disc space height is also seen at these levels. Grade I C3 on C4
     anterolisthesis is associated with very mild degenerative changes but is also
     likely chronic.  At the C6 level, the cervical spinal canal is narrowed to
     approximately 9 mm due to surrounding degenerative changes. Incidental note is
     made of a right apical pneumothorax.
      The junction of the head and neck of the left first rib is irregular,
     suggesting old trauma.  Incidental note is made of NG and ET tubes.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Suspect fracture of C-2.  See above discussion. Moderate-to-
     severe degenerative cervical osteoarthritis, as noted above.  C3 on C4 grade I
     anterolisthesis is probably degenerative.
     Modification of the report communicated to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6359**]. TK

                                     FINAL REPORT
     CT HEAD [**2966-7-14**].
     
     INDICATION:  Fall.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiple axial images of the head were obtained without
     intravenous contrast.
     
     UNENHANCED HEAD CT:  Multiple round foci of high attenuation are seen within
     the inferior left frontal lobe, anterior temporal horns and posterior right
     temporal lobe; these are consistent with contusions.  A small right subdural
     collection measures 6 mm in maximum diameter.  Fresh blood layers along the
     falx and in a parafalcine distribution.  High attenuation blood can also be
     seen along the orbital roof.  Minimal leftward shift of midline structures of
     1-2 mm is present.  There is mild mass effect on the right lateral ventricle.
     Diffuse low attenuation bilaterally within the centrum semiovale is more
     prominent on the right consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic changes;
     acute or chronic right ACA infarction is also a possibility.  No significant
     CSF space effacement is identified.  A subcutaneous hematoma extends over the
     left parieto-occipital region.  No fractures are identified on bone windows.
     Some low attenuation layering fluid and probable mucosal thickening is seen
     within the left maxillary sinus as well as in the ethmoid and sphenoid sinus.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Multiple bilateral parenchymal contusions within the frontal and temporal
     lobes, predominantly on the right.
     2.  Subdural hemorrhage.
     3.  Mild mass effect.  No fractures are identified.
     4.  Sinus mucosal disease with layering fluid; sinusitis should be considered.
     5. Possible right Anterior cerebral artery infarct.

     CT OF THE CHEST, ABDOMEN AND PELVIS [**2966-7-14**].
     
     INDICATION:  Fall.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiple axial images of the torso were obtained after intravenous
     administration of 150 cc of Optiray.  Optiray was administered due to the
     history of trauma; there were no complications.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The heart and great vessels are
     normal in appearance without evidence of extravasation of contrast. Asymmetric
     right paratracheal soft tissue above and at the level of the right
     tracheobronchial angle is of uncertain significance, but likely related to
     nonfilled azygos vein. There is a moderate- to- large right pneumothorax.  The
     heart and mediastinum are shifted to the left. ET and NG tubes are present.
     The left lung is normal in appearance and there are no pleural effusions.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The liver, gallbladder,
     pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands and kidneys are normal in appearance.  No
     free air or free fluid is seen in the abdomen.  The aorta is calcified, with
     intraluminal irregularities consistent with atherosclerotic disease.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There is focal soft tissue
     stranding adjacent to the left gluteal muscles, with some linear areas of high
     attenuation.  This most likely represents some mild extravasation of contrast
     in an area of traumatic injury.  A Foley catheter is in the bladder.  There is
     no free fluid in the pelvis.  A right groin intra-arterial line is present.
     
     No fractures are present.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Moderate-to-large right pneumothorax with shift of the mediastinum to the
     left.Increased soft tissue density in right  paratracheal region at site of
     azygos vein, of uncertain cause. but possibly related to non-contrast-filled
     azygos vein. No extravasated contrast in this region.
     2.  No evidence of vascular or solid organ injury.
     3.  Left gluteal soft tissue stranding and minimal active extravasation.
     Findings were communicated to the surgical team at the time of the study.

     administration of 150 cc of Optiray.  Optiray was administered due to the
     history of trauma; there were no complications.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The heart and great vessels are
     normal in appearance without evidence of extravasation of contrast. Asymmetric
     right paratracheal soft tissue above and at the level of the right
     tracheobronchial angle is of uncertain significance, but likely related to
     nonfilled azygos vein. There is a moderate- to- large right pneumothorax.  The
     heart and mediastinum are shifted to the left. ET and NG tubes are present.
     The left lung is normal in appearance and there are no pleural effusions.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The liver, gallbladder,
     pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands and kidneys are normal in appearance.  No
     free air or free fluid is seen in the abdomen.  The aorta is calcified, with
     intraluminal irregularities consistent with atherosclerotic disease.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There is focal soft tissue
     stranding adjacent to the left gluteal muscles, with some linear areas of high
     attenuation.  This most likely represents some mild extravasation of contrast
     in an area of traumatic injury.  A Foley catheter is in the bladder.  There is
     no free fluid in the pelvis.  A right groin intra-arterial line is present.
     
     No fractures are present.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Moderate-to-large right pneumothorax with shift of the mediastinum to the
     left.Increased soft tissue density in right  paratracheal region at site of
     azygos vein, of uncertain cause. but possibly related to non-contrast-filled
     azygos vein. No extravasated contrast in this region.
     2.  No evidence of vascular or solid organ injury.
     3.  Left gluteal soft tissue stranding and minimal active extravasation.
     Findings were communicated to the surgical team at the time of the study.

     CT OF THE CERVICAL SPINE DATED [**2966-7-14**].
     
     INDICATION:  Fall.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiple axial images of the cervical spine were obtained without
     intravenous contrast and reformatted in coronal and sagittal projections.
     
     CT OF THE CERVICAL SPINE WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  C1 through the upper
     portion of T2 are visualized.  No prevertebral soft-tissue swelling is seen.
     There is irregularity of the superior articular surface of C-2 on the left>
     This could represent old trauma but acute fracture is a distinct possibility.
     Multiple level osteophytic degeneration is seen, centered around C4 through
     C6.  Loss of disc space height is also seen at these levels. Grade I C3 on C4
     anterolisthesis is associated with very mild degenerative changes but is also
     likely chronic.  At the C6 level, the cervical spinal canal is narrowed to
     approximately 9 mm due to surrounding degenerative changes. Incidental note is
     made of a right apical pneumothorax.
      The junction of the head and neck of the left first rib is irregular,
     suggesting old trauma.  Incidental note is made of NG and ET tubes.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Suspect fracture of C-2.  See above discussion. Moderate-to-
     severe degenerative cervical osteoarthritis, as noted above.  C3 on C4 grade I
     anterolisthesis is probably degenerative.

     CHEST, AP SUPINE,  TWO VIEWS: The initial view demonstrates mainstem bronchus
     intubation and further collapse of the left lung.  The 2nd image demonstrates
     satisfactory endotracheal tube positioning with partial re-expansion of the
     left lung, and a new moderate to large right sided pneumothorax. There is
     shift of the mediastinum toward the left, however, it is unclear how much of
     this is related to volume loss from the resolving lung collapse and how much
     is related to tension from a pneumothorax. NG tube is well positioned.

     HISTORY:  S/P fall, known bleeds.  Please evaluate.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast head CT.
     
     FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to the previous exam of one day earlier. Today's
     examination is somewhat limited by patient motion during the acquisition of
     images.  Accounting for these limitations, there appears a slight interval
     improvement in the size/appearance of the previously described parenchymal
     contusions.  There is, however, a new subdural hematoma adjacent to the left
     frontoparietal region which measures approximately 5 X 1 cm in the AP and
     transverse dimensions respectively.  There is no significant adjacent mass
     effect. There is no ventriculomegaly or shift of the midline structures. Again
     noted is mucosal thickening and probable air fluid levels within both
     maxillary sinuses.  There is also opacification of the ethmoid air cells.  The
     osseous structures are stable in appearance.  There has been interval
     placement of a pressure monitor (bolt) adjacent to the peripheral portion of
     the right frontal lobe.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  New left-sided subdural hematoma.
     2)  Slight interval improvement in the size/appearance of the previously
     described multiple parenchymal contusions within the frontal and temporal
     lobes, more prominent on the right.
     
     These findings were immediately telephoned to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7439**] at the time of the
     examination.

                                     FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
     CT SCAN OF THE BRAIN W/O IV CONTRAST:
     
     HISTORY:  S/P fall.  Assess for subdural hemorrhage changes.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial noncontrast imaging of the brain was obtained.
     
     FINDINGS:  Comparison with the prior study of 6/18 redemonstrates the left-
     sided frontal-parietal subdural hemorrhage, which has not changed in size.
     Both the prior and present studies demonstrate a smaller right-sided cerebral
     convexity subdural hemorrhage, with a minimal degree of layering of higher
     density components on the dependent side.  Both examinations also show a mild
     to moderate bilateral mass effect with compression of both lateral ventricles
     with shift of normally midline structures.  The large right inferior frontal
     hemorrhagic contusion as well as scattered subarachnoid hemorrhage is
     unaltered in extent.  There is extensive opacification by soft tissue of the
     paranasal sinuses, likely related to intubation.  Both studies show
     considerable diffuse scalp soft tissue swelling.
     
     CONCLUSION:  Essentially stable, markedly abnormal scan as noted above.

     INDICATION:  Fall down 12 stairs, rule out fracture.
     
     Five views of the thoracic and lumbar spine are provided.  A right internal
     jugular catheter, right chest tube, endotracheal tube, and NG tube are
     appropriately positioned.  No large pneumothorax is identified on these supine
     radiographs.  There is loss of normal vertebral body height of the anterior
     superior portion of the L1 vertebral body, consistent with a compression
     fracture of indeterminate age.  No other fracture is identified.  Alignment
     appears anatomic.  SI joints appear normal but hips are not fully evaluated.
     
     IMPRESSION:  L1 compression deformity of indeterminate age.

Brief ROS-
Neuro: Pt. is much less responsive today than yesterday, per pt.s husband. Pt. opens eyes spont. Occ appears to track but not consistantly. Has not squeezed on command or moved toes. Pt. has moved legs on bed- she may wedge her foot up against rail to support body(either leg). She brought rt arm up to rest elbow up with hand on forehead(purposeful), but does not follow commands. Pupils are equil and reactive. Overbreaths vent consistantly, less tacypnic this evening. Sleeping now.

CV: Remains on labatelol, titrating to keep BP down below 160-150. Presently labatelolgtt is at 3mg( down from 6mg). CVP is stable, abt 12. HR is in the 60's-70's, sinus. Slightly irregular occ, rare apc. No vent ectopy. Color is gd, strong pulses, warm.

Resp: No vent changes this shift. Gd sats throughout. Suctioned occ for sml amts of wh to yellow secretions, sent a specimen this(cx) afternoon with rising temp. Remains tacypnic but slowed this evening later, she's sleeping.

GI: Tolerating tube feeds well, at goal. No BM's, abd soft. 

GU: Adequate u/o via foley, less hourly u/o later in shift- will monitor. May need lasix. 

Endo: BS 221-91, insulin gtt up to 4units and down to 1 unit. Will monitor.

Skin: Intact. Lrg areas of eccymosis over back side of trunk as well as her lower abdomen and upper thighs. 

Social: Husband in to visit for several hours this afternoon. He was very upset by pt.'s decline from yesterday( she'd been re-intubated, seemed less responsive and he was told she may have a pneumonia), very tearful and discouraged. Nrs encouraged pt. to stay positive and that pneumonia(if it was confirmed) was a set-back only.

     AP bedside chest. Metallic tip of the feeding tube is in the mid stomach.
     Satisfactorily positioned right IJ line and ETT. Heart normal size. There are
     diffuse as well as scattered focal air space disease throughout all lobes of
     both lungs. The heart is normal in size and I doubt the presence of vascular
     congestion (suboptimal assessment). Since exam 1 day previous, the patchy
     bilateral infiltrates have increased in extent.
     
     IMPRESSION: Short interval increase in bilateral unusual air space disease is
     not typical of fluid overload or simple pneumonia.

     HISTORY:  S/P fall with bilateral subdural hematomas, now with increased ICP.
     Assess for new intracranial bleeding.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast CT exam of the head.
     
     FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to a previous exam of [**2966-7-18**].  Again noted are
     contusions of the right temporal and frontal regions.  There is a stable
     appearing left frontoparietal extra-axial hemorrhage.  There has been no
     change in the previously described small amount of subarachnoid and
     intraventricular hemorrhage.  There is no evidence of new mass effect, shift
     of the mid-line structures or increased edema of the brain parenchyma.  The
     ventricles are stable in appearance.  The previously described low attenuation
     region in the distribution of the right anterior cerebral artery is more
     isodense to the surrounding brain parenchyma on today's exam.  There is no
     evidence of new major/minor vascular territorial infarcts.
     
     The visualized soft tissues, osseous structures and paranasal sinuses are
     stable in appearance.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1)  Stable appearance of multiple hemorrhages, as compared to the
     previous exam of [**2966-7-18**].  No evidence of new intra/extra-axial hemorrhages or
     mass effect.
     
     2)  Changes consistent with an evolving infarction in the distribution of the
     right anterior cerebral artery, as described above.
     
     The above findings were discussed in detail with the surgical house staff
     caring for the patient at the time of the examination.

SOCIAL WORK NOTE:
Met with pt's husband and dtr today to offer continued support.  They are very saddened by pt's need for reintubation and by her pneumonia.  Husband said he feared that she would get pneumonia.  He describes himself as someone who does best when he can directly affect something (i.e. if a floorboard is loose then he picks up a hammer and nails and fixes it) and it is very difficult for him to not be able to affect her state of health.  He misses having her at home and remains hopeful that she will be able to recover.  This SW remains involved for support as needed.  Pager [**Pager number 117**].

      72 year old woman with subdural hematomac2 fracture                             
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      for PE prophylaxis                                                              
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: Status post fall with subdural hematoma and T2 fracture. Requiring
     prophylactic IVC filter.
     
     PHYSICIANS: Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 7451**], [**Name5 (PTitle) 22**], and staff supervising radiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 263**]
     [**Name (STitle) 264**] performing the procedure.
     
     MEDICATION/CONTRAST: 1% lidocaine was administered locally. A total of 1 mg of
     Versed and 50 mcg of Fentanyl was administered intravenously in divided doses
     under continuous hemodynamic monitoring for conscious sedation purpose. 35 cc
     of nonionic contrast was administered IV. Optiray was selected secondary to
     debilitated state and history of question of dye allergy.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Risks and benefits were explained to the patient's husband, health
     care proxy. Telephone consent was obtained. The patient was placed in the
     supine position and the right groin was prepped and draped in a sterile
     fashion. Utilizing fluoroscopic guidance, a 18 gauge single wall needle was
     advanced into the right common femoral vein followed by passage of 0.035
     straight [**Last Name (un) 528**] wire to the inferior vena cava. A 4 French pigtail catheter
     was advanced over the wire and positioned within the right common iliac vein
     and a inferior vena cavogram was performed. The level of the renal veins were
     noted. The right renal vein was lower than the left. Multiple tract
     dilatations were performed with eventual passage of 12 French sheath over the
     wire. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 7452**] filter was advanced over the wire and deployed in an
     infrarenal location. An x-ray of the abdomen was taken. The wire and sheath
     were removed and manual groin compression was applied until hemostasis was
     achieved.
     
     FINDINGS: The inferior vena cavagram demonstrates no iliocaval thrombus and
     single bilateral renal veins. The deployed [**Location (un) 7452**] filter rests with tip at
     the level of the inflow of the right renal vein.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  No immediate complications were noted.
     
     IMPRESSION: Status post successful placement of infrarenal [**Location (un) 7452**] filter.

      72 year old woman with subdural hematomac2 fracture                             
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: Status post fall with subdural hematoma and T2 fracture. Requiring
     prophylactic IVC filter.
     
     PHYSICIANS: Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 7451**], [**Name5 (PTitle) 22**], and staff supervising radiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 263**]
     [**Name (STitle) 264**] performing the procedure.
     
     MEDICATION/CONTRAST: 1% lidocaine was administered locally. A total of 1 mg of
     Versed and 50 mcg of Fentanyl was administered intravenously in divided doses
     under continuous hemodynamic monitoring for conscious sedation purpose. 35 cc
     of nonionic contrast was administered IV. Optiray was selected secondary to
     debilitated state and history of question of dye allergy.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Risks and benefits were explained to the patient's husband, health
     care proxy. Telephone consent was obtained. The patient was placed in the
     supine position and the right groin was prepped and draped in a sterile
     fashion. Utilizing fluoroscopic guidance, a 18 gauge single wall needle was
     advanced into the right common femoral vein followed by passage of 0.035
     straight [**Last Name (un) 528**] wire to the inferior vena cava. A 4 French pigtail catheter
     was advanced over the wire and positioned within the right common iliac vein
     and a inferior vena cavogram was performed. The level of the renal veins were
     noted. The right renal vein was lower than the left. Multiple tract
     dilatations were performed with eventual passage of 12 French sheath over the
     wire. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 7452**] filter was advanced over the wire and deployed in an
     infrarenal location. An x-ray of the abdomen was taken. The wire and sheath
     were removed and manual groin compression was applied until hemostasis was
     achieved.
     
     FINDINGS: The inferior vena cavagram demonstrates no iliocaval thrombus and
     single bilateral renal veins. The deployed [**Location (un) 7452**] filter rests with tip at
     the level of the inflow of the right renal vein.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  No immediate complications were noted.

Resp:  She remains extubated.  Her cough has been getting stronger over the day.  She is able to cough her secretions above her cords and swallow.  Her RR has been 24-30, FiO2 40% face tent with O2 sats 99-100%.

Cardiac: Her B/P was 140-156/50-60's, HR 80's.  Her B/P started to increased after noon so that by 1800 her pressure was 180/70.  Her lisinopril was increased to 10mg QD.

GI: tube feedings have remained at goal rate of 60cc/hr through the pedi tube.  No stools.  She was on an insulin gtt this am at 6u/hr.  At 8am her BS was 80 so the Insulin was decreased to 4u/hr then turned off at 9:30 after her BS was found to be 67 so the gtt was D/C'ed for 90 min.  Her BS increased to 150's so it was restarted at 2u/hr at 11am.  At 12n it was ordered to D/C the gtt so at 12:30 she was given 12u of NPH and 7u of regular for a BS of 161.  At 1330 the gtt was D/C'ed and her BS has been 130-140 since.  

Neuro: She is moving her right side well, the left leg and arm have not moved to my knowledge.  She has been awake and alert, however she has her episodes where she will answer simple questions appropriately and time she will just parrot what was said to her.  She has remained restrained because she continues to try to pull off her O2 mask and she could still pull out the pedi-feeding tube.  No haldol was given today.

GU:  U/O has been good today so that her I&O is even since MN.  Her lasix was D/C'ed.

ID:  She has been afebrile today.  She finished her coarse of antibotics so they were all D/C'ed. 

Lines: She has 2 perpherial lines that are working well so the triple lumen was D/C'ed (line was sent for culture) and the A-Line was D/C'ed.

Plan: monitor her BS during the night and continue to cover with sliding scale insulin, if she remains stable she will be called out of the unit tomorrow.

     INDICATION:  72 year old female status post cerebrovascular accident with
     impaired swallowing abnormality.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 23**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 346**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 23**], Staff Radiologist,
     was present throughout the procedure.
     
     CONTRAST/MEDICATIONS:  20 ml of Conray 60%; 50 mcg fentanyl in divided doses
     under continued hemodynamic monitoring for conscious sedation. 
     
     PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:  The procedure was described to the patient's
     family and informed consent was obtained.  The stomach was insufflated with
     air via the pre-existing nasogastric tube, and the skin and soft tissues just
     inferior to the left costal margin were infiltrated using 1% lidocaine.  Two
     T-fasteners were then placed under fluoroscopic guidance into the anterior
     body of the stomach, securing the stomach to the anterior abdominal wall.  The
     stomach was then accessed using the 20-gauge needle, and a small amount of
     contrast was injected following puncture of the stomach to document position.
     A 0.035 [**Doctor Last Name 555**] wire was then advanced without difficulty into the gastric
     antrum, the needle was exchanged for a 7-French sheath.
     
     At this time, access into the C-loop was attempted using several different
     wires and catheters.  Specific catheters used were initially a 5-French multi-
     purpose catheter, followed by a 5-French Kumpe catheter.  A 5-French SOS Omni
     catheter was then used with an angled Glidewire, and access was eventually
     gained into the C-loop using this combination.  The Glidewire was advanced to
     the level of the jejunum, and the catheter was then exchanged under
     fluoroscopic guidance for the 5-French multipurpose catheter.  A 0.035 Amplatz
     Super Stiff straight wire was then advanced through the multipurpose catheter,
     and the catheter and sheath were subsequently removed.  The tract was then
     dilated to 14 French, followed by placement of a 14-French peel-away
     sheath/dilator system.  The dilator was subsequently removed, and a 14-French
     [**Doctor Last Name 939**] gastrojejunostomy catheter was advanced over the wire, through the
     sheath and to the level of the jejunum.  The sheath was subsequently peeled
     away, and traction was placed on the suture material, forming the locking loop
     in the region of the duodenal bulb.  Contrast material was then injected,
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT
     
     
     INDICATION:  72 year old female status post cerebrovascular accident with
     impaired swallowing abnormality.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 23**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 346**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 23**], Staff Radiologist,
     was present throughout the procedure.
     
     CONTRAST/MEDICATIONS:  20 ml of Conray 60%; 50 mcg fentanyl in divided doses
     under continued hemodynamic monitoring for conscious sedation. 
     
     PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:  The procedure was described to the patient's
     family and informed consent was obtained.  The stomach was insufflated with
     air via the pre-existing nasogastric tube, and the skin and soft tissues just
     inferior to the left costal margin were infiltrated using 1% lidocaine.  Two
     T-fasteners were then placed under fluoroscopic guidance into the anterior
     body of the stomach, securing the stomach to the anterior abdominal wall.  The
     stomach was then accessed using the 20-gauge needle, and a small amount of
     contrast was injected following puncture of the stomach to document position.
     A 0.035 [**Doctor Last Name 555**] wire was then advanced without difficulty into the gastric
     antrum, the needle was exchanged for a 7-French sheath.
     
     At this time, access into the C-loop was attempted using several different
     wires and catheters.  Specific catheters used were initially a 5-French multi-
     purpose catheter, followed by a 5-French Kumpe catheter.  A 5-French SOS Omni
     catheter was then used with an angled Glidewire, and access was eventually
     gained into the C-loop using this combination.  The Glidewire was advanced to
     the level of the jejunum, and the catheter was then exchanged under
     fluoroscopic guidance for the 5-French multipurpose catheter.  A 0.035 Amplatz
     Super Stiff straight wire was then advanced through the multipurpose catheter,
     and the catheter and sheath were subsequently removed.  The tract was then
     dilated to 14 French, followed by placement of a 14-French peel-away
     sheath/dilator system.  The dilator was subsequently removed, and a 14-French
     [**Doctor Last Name 939**] gastrojejunostomy catheter was advanced over the wire, through the
     sheath and to the level of the jejunum.  The sheath was subsequently peeled
     away, and traction was placed on the suture material, forming the locking loop
     in the region of the duodenal bulb.  Contrast material was then injected,
                                                                 (Over)

     followed by 10 ml of normal saline.  An image was obtained at this time,
     documenting the loop projecting over the region of the duodenum.  The catheter
     crosses to the left of midline, and then back to the right.  There is contrast
     material visualized throughout the proximal jejunum.  Incidental note is made
     of an inferior vena caval filter in position.
     
     The catheter was then secured to the patient's skin using 0 Prolene suture
     material and Flexi-Track dressing.  The tube is ready for immediate use.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a 14-French [**Doctor Last Name 939**] percutaneous
     gastrojejunostomy catheter. The tube is ready for immediate use.  No
     complications.
