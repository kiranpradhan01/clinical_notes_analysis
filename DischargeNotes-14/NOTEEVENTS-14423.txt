Pertinent Results:
R Ankle/Foot X-ray
1. Prominent soft tissue swelling at the first toe amputation 
site with a probable small ulceration of the distal soft 
tissues. The appearance of the remaining aspect of the first 
metatarsal is unchanged, although radiographs have limited 
sensitivity for detection of osteomyelitis.
2. Additional postoperative changes of the right foot are 
unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
82 y/o M w/ h/o CAD, DMII, R foot ulcer, s/p recent amputation, 
MSSA bacteremia, who presents with fever/hypotension
. 
# MSSA Bacteremia: Initially presented with hypotension and SIRS 
criteria including fever, tachycardia, leukocytosis, was 
admitted to the Medical ICU. Hypotension was fluid responsive 
after 2.5L NS and he had no evidence of end organ damage. He did 
not require pressor support. Given his recent MSSA bacteremia (S 
to oxacillin, clinda) and preliminary R hallux wound culture 
with GP Cocci, he was treated empirically with vanco/clinda IV. 
Blood culture data returned 4/4 bottles positive for methicillin 
sensitive staph aureus, and antibiotics were tapered to IV 
nafcillin. Suspected source was his R hallux ulcer which also 
grew MSSA. This ulcer was debrided by the podiatry service. 
Surveilence blood cultures remained negative to date and he has 
remained hemodynamically stable; his last positive blood culture 
was on [**3065-10-3**].  Oral dicloxacillin was discussed as an 
alternative antibiotic, but he will be discharged on a two week 
course of nafcillin IV because of his high grade bacteremia and 
diabetes (To be continued through [**10-17**]).  He got a 
transesophageal echo as an inpatient to rule out endocarditis 
given his risk factors, which was negative.
. 
# DM type 2: Controlled with sliding scale insulin while 
inpatient. Resumed metformin and glyburide.  With rising 
creatine, will monitor for hypoglycemia in the setting of being 
on glyburide as well as problems with metformin.   Please 
consider changing to glipizide if this becomes a problem.  
.
# CAD/CHF: s/p CABG in [**3047**]; no signs of active ischemia or 
volume overload. Continued on simvastatin, ASA. Metoprolol, 
lasix held until HD stable and subsequently re-started.  Will 
start lisinopril today prior to discharge for improved mortality 
benefit.  Will need a creatinine check 10 days after starting 
ACE-I (on [**10-20**]) to ensure that Cr not elevated.  Consider 
starting spironolactone if his creatinine remains stable over 
next few days.
.  
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Initial creat 1.5, baseline 
creat 1.2-1.4. Likely pre-renal component. Volume repleted with 
IVF's and pRBC and creatinine returned to baseline levels.  On 
discharge, he was 1.5.  He should have this checked in one week.
.
# Insomnia/anxiety: The patient had an episode where he crawled 
out of bed after receiving Ativan and Ambien.  We stopped both 
of these medications and gave him haldol for [**Doctor Last Name 292**] (2mg) with 
good effect.  As a result of this, he has an abrasion of his 
right elbow which is superficial in nature, not requiring 
stitches.  He also required olanzapine for anxiety.  He should 
follow up with his PCP for his chronic anxiety/insomnia 
problems.
.  
# Atrial fib: Rate controlled, holding coumadin anti-coagulation 
in setting of recent GI bleed. Follow-up with cardiology as 
outpatient to assess whether or not to restart coumadin given 
that patient is a fall risk.
. 
# Anemia: Initial hematocrit 26. guaiac negative. Transfused 1 
unit pRBC given h/o CAD and PVD with appropriate increase to 29. 
 His hematocrit has been stable since.  
.
# R foot ulcer: As above, treated with antibiotics and 
debridement. Podiatry and Vascular surgery consulted. Vanco 
given for MSSA and levo/flagyl empirically at first, switched to 
nafcillin prior to discharge.  He needs to follow up with 
vascular surgery as an outpatient given his non-healing ulcer 
and repeated infections as well as with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] of podiatry for 
repacking/resuturing of foot.  
.
# Dispo: Patient seen by PT/OT and it was felt that the best 
thing for him in terms of rehabilitation is to go to a rehab 
center.
