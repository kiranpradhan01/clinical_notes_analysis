Admission Date:  [**2836-7-29**]       Discharge Date:  [**2836-8-9**]

Date of Birth:   [**2789-10-15**]       Sex:  F

Service:  Medicine

ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Diabetic ketoacidosis

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms [**Known patient lastname 11076**] is a 46 year old woman
with a past medical history of Type 1 diabetes, retinopathy,
peripheral neuropathy and multiple admissions of diabetic
ketoacidosis who was transferred from an outside hospital on
[**2836-7-28**].  By report several days prior to admission, the
patient began experiencing nausea and vomiting.  On the day
of admission she was found by her mother to be lethargic with
decreased responsiveness.  She was taken to an outside
hospital where her glucose was found to be 1,258 with a
creatinine of 5.9, potassium of 7.6, and a bicarbonate of
less than 5.  An arterial blood gases showed pH of
7.01/12/107.  The electrocardiogram showed changes consistent
with hypokalemia.  The patient was given insulin, intravenous
fluids and bicarbonate.  This resulted in improvement of her
electrocardiogram.  She was transferred to [**Hospital6 291**] for further care.  In the
Emergency Department here she was aggressively hydrated with
normal saline and started on Dopamine for blood pressure
support.  She received a total of 11 liters of intravenous
fluids in the Emergency Department and was transferred to
Medical Intensive Care Unit.  At the time the patient denied
any shortness of breath, fevers, chills, chest pain, or
abdominal pain.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Type 1 diabetes with multiple
admissions for diabetic ketoacidosis, retinopathy, peripheral
neuropathy; 2.  Hypertension; 3.  Depression.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Atarax 50 mg prn; Calcium
carbonate 650 mg b.i.d.; Ferrous Sulfate 325 mg b.i.d.;
Flonase 2 puffs each nostril q.d.; Epogen 2000 units Tuesday
and Wednesday; Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg q.d.; Lantis 10
units subcutaneously q.h.s.; Lisinopril 20 mg b.i.d.; Ativan
prn; Methoxa-Dome 600 mg q.h.s.; Neurontin 900 mg t.i.d.;
Protonix 40 mg q. AM; Humalog sliding scale q.i.d.

ALLERGIES:  Tegretol, Prozac and Procardia.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination at admission
revealed the patient was in mild distress.  Temperature was
98.1, heartrate 100, blood pressure 95/50.  Her mucous
membranes were slightly dry.  There was no jugulovenous
distension.  There was regular rhythm with normal S1 and S2.
There were no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  A few rales were
noted at the right base.  The abdomen was soft, nontender
with bowel sounds present.  There was no peripheral edema.
The patient was awake and answered questions appropriately.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data at admission, white count
18.6 with 79% neutrophils.  Hematocrit was 22.4, platelets
324, sodium 133, potassium 4.0, chloride 90, bicarbonate 15,
BUN 81, creatinine 4.9, glucose 847, anion gap 28.  An
arterial blood gases revealed 7.28/31/107.  Urinalysis was
positive for glucose.  Toxicology screen was positive for
opioids and tricyclics.  Chest x-ray showed no signs of
pneumonia or heart failure.  An electrocardiogram revealed
normal sinus rhythm at 102.  The axis was normal.  There were
ST depressions in V3 through V6.  There were peak T waves.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Ms [**Known patient lastname 11076**] was transferred to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit.  Her course in the hospital will be
discussed by systems.

1.  Endocrine - Ms [**Known patient lastname 11076**] was aggressively hydrated.  She was
placed on her insulin drip.  He anion gap was followed.  She
responded well to this treatment and her blood sugar
continued to come down.  As the blood sugar control improved
she was restarted on her outpatient medications, Lantis 10
units q.h.s. and a regular insulin sliding scale.  The day
prior to discharge she was restarted on her Humalog sliding
scale which she uses as an outpatient.

Of note, Ms [**Known patient lastname 11076**] was found to have hypercholesterolemia
during this admission.  She was started on Atorvastatin.

2.  Pulmonary - On the night of admission Ms [**Known patient lastname 11076**] developed
dyspnea and increasing oxygen requirements.  She required
intubation.  A repeat chest x-ray showed complete white out
of the right lung, this was rapid advancement and her chest
x-ray on admission had been clear.  It was thought that these
changes were likely secondary to an aspiration pneumonia.
She had been vomiting prior to admission.  She was started on
a course of Levofloxacin, Ceftriaxone and Vancomycin.  She
improved gradually and was extubated on [**8-5**].  Chest x-ray
done the day prior to discharge showed marked improvement and
clearing of the right lung.  Her antibiotic course ended on
[**8-8**].

3.  Cardiovascular - Hypertension, Ms [**Known patient lastname 11076**] was very
hypotensive on admission, requiring pressors for several
days.  These were eventually weaned.  After her massive
volume resuscitation she became hypertensive.  It was
difficult to control her hypertension.  At the time of
discharge her medications included Captopril, Amlodipine,
Metoprolol, Hydralazine.

The day after admission Ms [**Known patient lastname 11076**] [**Last Name (Titles) 11077**] in by enzymes for a
myocardial infarction.  There were no ST elevations noted on
electrocardiogram.  Once she was medically stabilized, she
underwent cardiac catheterization on [**8-7**].  This showed a
nonocclusive coronary artery disease with a 40% lesion in the
mid left anterior descending.  The right coronary artery had
a 40% proximal lesion.  The left ventricular ejection
fraction was 54%.  An echocardiogram revealed mild to
moderate mitral regurgitation.

Tachycardia, Ms [**Known patient lastname 11076**] remained tachycardiac throughout much
of her admission.  She was eventually controlled on
Metoprolol 125 mg p.o. b.i.d.

4.  Gastrointestinal - During the admission Ms [**Known patient lastname 11076**] was
noted to have black tarry stools.  Her hematocrit dropped and
she required transfusion of 3 units of packed red blood
cells.  The gastrointestinal service was consulted.  Her
hematocrit stabilized at approximately 30.  She was no longer
acutely bleeding.  The presumptive diagnosis was
stress-induced gastritis.  Given her recent myocardial
infarction, the gastrointestinal service felt that an
esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy were not
necessitated at this time.  They would like her to follow up
and receive an outpatient esophagogastroduodenoscopy and
colonoscopy.  They also recommended that she continue
Protonix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.

5.  Renal - Ms [**Known patient lastname 11076**] came in in acute renal failure.  This
was thought to be secondary to prerenal/acute tubular
necrosis causes.  She responded to massive volume
resuscitation.  She maintained good urine output.  At the
time of discharge her creatinine is 0.8.

6.  Dermatology - Ms [**Known patient lastname 11076**] developed an irritation rash over
her buttocks.  This was treated with Lidocaine ointment, and
has responded well.

7.  Infectious disease - Ms [**Known patient lastname 11076**] completed a ten day course
of antibiotics.  At the time of discharge she had been
afebrile for several days.  All of her cultures are negative
to date.

8.  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - Ms [**Known patient lastname 11076**]
experienced hypocalcemia as well as hypomagnesemia during her
admission.  She is on supplements to treat her electrolyte
abnormalities at the time of discharge.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Rapidly progressive right lung opacification in patient with
     diabetic ketoacidosis and hypoxia.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  CT imaging of the chest without contrast enhancement.  No
     intravenous contrast material was given due to acute renal failure.
     
     CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST: There is no prior CT for comparison.  The tip of the
     introducer sheath is in the superior vena cava.  The heart, pericardium, and
     great vessels are normal in appearance.  There is extensive consolidation
     throughout the right lung, with slight residual aeration in non-dependent
     portions.  There was also a moderate right pleural effusion.  There are
     smoothly thickened interlobular septae in the small, aerated portion of the
     right lung apex.
     
     On the left, there is a small pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.
     
     In the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, there is a small amount of
     ascites.  Several small, calcified gallstones and splenic arterial
     calcification are noted.
     
     The skeletal structures are normal.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. Extensive consolidation of the right lung and adjacent pleural effusion.
     The rapid development of these findings is suggestive of massive aspiration
     with subsequent edema.
     2. Small left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.
     3. Small amount of ascites in the upper abdomen.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATIONS:   Diabetic ketoacidosis. Patient may now be in shock.
     FINDINGS: A single AP supine chest image is provided. The comparison study is
     taken with the patient upright nine hours earlier the same day. There has been
     a dramatic change in the appearances of the patient's chest. There is now a
     large rounded opacity overlying the right lower zone and another large rounded
     opacity overlying the right midzone laterally.  These opacities are fairly
     well circumscribed on their medial aspect but blend with the pleural surface
     on the lateral aspect.  It is difficult to be certain whether they represent
     pleural or parenchymal collections.  probably both.  There has been a marked
     reduction in aerated lung volume on the right side. The left lung remains
     fairly well inflated and is unchanged.  No evidence of any pulmonary
     infiltrate or effusion is seen on the left side. The cardiac silhouette also
     is essentially unchanged. It may be slightly enlarged and there is slight
     unfolding of the aorta.
     
     IMPRESSION:   The dramatic appearance of the large opacities in the right
     hemithorax raises the question of a massive hematoma or fulminating infection
     with pleural and parenchymal involvement.  Is there any suggestion of blood
     loss clinically? If the patient can be transferred to the radiology department
     for CT evaluation these findings would be clarified. This might help to
     determine further intervention which might be necessary.  Alternatively a
     short term followup exam would also be helpful.

MICU B Nursing Progress Note

Please see carevue for all objective data. Pt. extremely unstable throughout the past 12 hr. Essentially, CXR has progressed rapidly from clear to completely [**Last Name (un) 1269**] out right side, confirmed by chest CT. Oxygen requirements increased dramatically and pt. semi-electively intubated. Bronchosccopy performed and multiple specs sent. ?severe community acquired pneumonia leading to sepsis and multisystem organ failure (renal failure, DKA, cardiac). Pt. also ruling in for acute MI, with increased pressor requirements. S-G placed...?cardiogenic vs. septic shock. Treatment with activated Protein C to be initiated.

CNS: Pt. initially quite lethargic, oriented to person and place, somewhat uncooperative. Prior to intubation, mental status had actually improved ...however, pt. is now  sedated on ativan gtt at 1mg/hr (varying rates d/t hypotension) with fentanyl ordered if needed. 

RESP: Currently on A/C 100% 500 x 12 with ABG's of 92/33/7.35/19. Prior to intubation, NTS done for moderate amount of thick, tan secretions. Bronchoscopy also performed at the bedside.

CVS: Pt. hypotensive off and on, on increasing amounts of dopamine, received NS 500cc IV boluses x 2. Levophed eventually added and dopa quickly weaned and dc'ed. Levo infusing at .17mcg/kg/min. Vasopressin also added and is now maxed at .04U. B/P has stabilized out at 90/syst, heart rate 80's-100's, NSR. Ruling in for MI with elevated troponin. ECHO done...?results. Initial swan readings with PAP 30/20, PCWP of 18 and CVP of 18. Awaiting confirmation of placement prior to obtaining cardiac output.

ENDO: Glucose has slowly come down and in currently 150 on 4U insulin/hr and D5NS at 200cc/hr. Will continue to follow with q1hr fingersticks. Follow up with HO re:decreasing gtt further. 

HEME: Hct of 26. Pt. received 1UPRBC's with repeat pending. 

GI: NPO. Passing small amounts of soft, brown, guiac negative stool. 

SKIN: Intact. 

ID: T max of 99po. Levofloxacin and clinda have been started. 

SOCIAL: Mother has been updated by housestaff. Unsure of social situation...family will need a lot of support.

     CLINICAL INDICATION:  DKA.  Pneumonia.  
     
     Compared to one day earlier.
     
     A SG catheter has been advanced in the interval and is now within the distal
     interlobar right PA.  ET tube appears slightly lower interval but is likely
     accentuated by the flexed position of the patient's neck, and a left
     subclavian central venous catheter is in satisfactory position.
     
     The heart size and mediastinal contours are stable.  There remains an alveolar
     pattern within the right lung diffusely, but this has slightly improved since
     the recent study and has dramatically improved when compared to earlier films
     dating back to [**2836-7-29**].  There remains a left retrocardiac opacity, which is
     stable since a recent exam.  Bilateral pleural effusions are noted, right
     greater than left.
     
     Additionally, there is an area of increased opacity, which is relatively
     sharply marginated and obscures part of the right heart border.  This appears
     stable compared to the recent study and may represent a component of
     atelectasis within the right middle lobe region.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1. Slight improvement in alveolar pattern within the right lung, consistent
     with improving pneumonia.  There is likely a component of atelectasis within
     the right middle lobe region.
     
     2. No significant change in left retrocardiac opacity or bilateral pleural
     effusions, right greater than left.
     
     3. Advancement of SG catheter, now terminating in interlobar portion of right
     pulonary artery.

  Neuro:  Recieved pt sedated on ativan 1.5 mg/hr and fentanyl 25 mcg/hr.  On these settings, pt having frequent periods of breakthrough aggitation, attempting to sit up, fighting restraints, bucking ventilator etc.  Intermittantly, she would follow commands, open eyes spontaneously.  Pt definately moves all extremities strongly.  Gtts increased to 2.0 mg/hr and 50 mcg/hr for several hours overnight to control agitation.  Gtt's weaned again towards morning in anticipation of ? extubation.  Pupils 2-3mm and reactive.  
  CV:  Afebrile.  Pt in SR 90's with no ectopy.  Per cardiology goal is afterload reduction.  Since titration of captopril was not controling BP, nipride gtt started at 2300 for goal MAP around 90.  Currently pt on 0.6 mcg/kg/min with BP 118/80 (90).  However, titration is difficult when pt awake/agitated as she becomes very hypertensive.  On nipride, pts SVR has decreased from 2700 to 1700 and her CO has increased from 3.0 to 4.38. Plan to continue titration of captopril and nipride to control BP.  Pt also diuresed with 40 mg IV lasix--good response, she is currently about 500 cc net out since midnight.  After diuresis, wedge decreased from high 20's to mid teens (last = 18).  K+ from 2200 = 3.5-->repleted with 40 meq Kcl PO.  AM labs pending.  
  Pulm:  Pt recieved on PSV 18/5 with RR in mid teens and TV around 500.  Pt placed on IMV briefly for metabolic study by RT (See note).

     Patient with DKA, respiratory failure secondary to aspiration pneumonia.
     Evaluate for pulmonary infiltrate, follow-up examination.
     
     FINDINGS:  The AP single view is evaluated in comparison with the next-
     preceding examination of [**2836-8-5**].  The patient is now extubated and the
     previously present NG tube has been removed.  The previously-described diffuse
     bilateral parenchymal densities are markedly reduced and the pulmonary
     parenchyma is almost completely normalized.  Some minor small plate
     atelectases remain on the right base and mild bluntings of the lateral pleural
     sinuses are also present.  No new parenchymal infiltrates have occurred.  The
     heart size is well within normal limits and no CHF pattern is identified. No
     evidence of pneumothorax exists.
     
     Comparison shows that the left subclavian approach central venous line remains
     in unchanged position.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Marked improvement of the previously-described parenchymal
     infiltrates and pleural densities.

     INDICATION:  Screening.  Nulliparous patient.  Menarche age 11.
     
     SCREENING MAMMOGRAPHY:  There is extensive vascular calcification present in
     this 47 year old patient who is an insulin dependent diabetic, consistent with
     vasculopathy.  The breast tissues are heterogeneously dense.  This limits
     evaluation for masses somewhat particularly in the outer halves.  There are
     three microcalcifications seen laterally in the left breast on CC view and at
     least two far superiorly on the MLO view.  At least two are seen on CC view
     in [**2835**] and 2002.  There is no developing density.  As there are one or two
     more calcifications six month follow up is recommended.  No other change is
     seen.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Six month follow up to the left breast recommended.  Note is made
     this is being dictated on the date of her six month follow up of [**2837-10-5**] as it
     is not clear if the original dictation was recorded.  The films were checked
     out of our department on [**4-21**] and taken directly to Dr.[**Doctor Last Name 11826**] office without
     initial review.  BIRADS 3 - probably benign, but one or two more
     microcalcifications on the left, six month follow up recommended.
