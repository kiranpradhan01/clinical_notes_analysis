     CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST                                            Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 7127**]
     Reason: r/o increase hemorrhage, edema
     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      81 year old woman with right basal ganglia hemorrhage, becoming obtunded over
      last 2hrs since previous CT at OSH
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      r/o increase hemorrhage, edema
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: 81 year old woman with right basal ganglia hemorrhage becoming
     obtunded over last two hours.
     
     COMPARISON: Comparison is made with prior CT of the head performed at [**Location (un) 7128**]
     [**Hospital 7129**] Hospital at 19:37 hours on [**2987-2-18**].
     
     TECHNIQUE: CT head without contrast.
     
     CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST: There has been interval increase in hemorrhage within
     the right basal ganglia and further extension medially and superiorly.  The
     hemorrhage now extends across the midline and into the right frontal horns of
     the lateral ventricle.  Blood fluid levels are present within the posterior
     horns bilaterally.  Hemorrhage appears to extend into the third ventricle. Low
     attenuation areas are present surrounding the hemorrhage most prominently in
     the right frontal white matter.  The ventricles do not appear significantly
     changed in size although there is slightly more right to left shift.  There
     does not appear to have been significant interval effacement of the sulci.
     
     IMPRESSION: Interval progression and extension of right basal ganglia
     parenchymal hemorrhage.  Results discussed with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4284**], neurosurgery PA,
     at time of study.

SON CALLED 911 AND SHE WAS TAKEN TO [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] HOSPITAL WHERE A CT SCAN SHOWED A BASAL GANGLION HEMMORRHAGE WITH MIN SHIFT. WHILE SHE WAS AT [**Location (un) **] SHE WAS GIVEN LABETOLOL TO MAINTAIN LOWERED BP. SHE ALSO HAD EPISODE OF VOMITTING WHEN SHE BECAME BRADYCARDIC TO 30'S. SHE WAS THEN TRANSFERRED TO [**Hospital1 10**] ER WHERE SHE ARRIVED MORE SOMMULENT. SHE WAS CHANGED TO NIPRIDE DRIP AND REPEAT CT SHOWED WORSENED BLEED. SHE ALSO VOMITTED AND BECAME BRADYCARDIC TO 40'S. TRANSFERRED TO NSICU FOR FURTHER MONITORING. HYPERTENSIVE TO 200'S ON ARRIVAL BUT HAS SINCE BEEN MAINTAINED 130-150 WITH NIPRIDE DRIP.
