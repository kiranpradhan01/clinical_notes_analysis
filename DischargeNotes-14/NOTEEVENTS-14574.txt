None
 
History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known patient lastname 1057**] is an 80yo female with PMH significant for Alzheimers 
and HTN. She initially presented on [**1-1**] with blood tinged, 
mucoid stools. She was found to have proctitis on CT scan. She 
was placed on Cipro and Flagyl but this was changed to 
Levaquin/Flagyl/Vancomycin. On [**1-7**] the patient was found to be 
choking and she progressively became more tachypneic and 
unresponsive. She was transferred to the MICU for closer 
management. Given her respiratory failure she was intubated. Her 
acute decline in respiratory status was thought to be due to a 
possible aspiration pneumonia vs. mucus plugging. Patient 
improved and was successfully extubated yesterday. She is now 
being transferred to the medical floor.

[**1-1**] KUB
IMPRESSION:
1. Lack of distal sigmoid colon and rectum included on 
radiograph limits evaluation for distal impaction. Slightly 
prominent loops of large bowel with non-dilatation of small 
bowel. Recommend repeat radiograph for better evaluation.
2. Probable multilevel compression fractures of unclear 
chronicity.
.
[**1-2**] CXR
IMPRESSION:
Developing density at both bases, particularly on the left side 
consistent with atelectasis/airspace disease with likely 
superimposed early edema. Findings discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] 
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known patient lastname 1057**] is an 80 yo female with PMH significant for dementia 
who initially presented with bloody/mucoid diarrhea, fevers and 
leukocytosis, found to have proctitis. She was transferred to 
the MICU for respiratory failure and intubated. She returns to 
the medical floor extubated.

1)Diarrhea: Most likely infectious in context of fever, 
leukocytosis, and mucoid-bloody stool. CT scan suggests 
proctitis. She was initially started on cipro/flagyl on 
admission, but given her continued fevers, her coverage was 
broadened with Vancomycin on [**1-3**] and subsequently devervesced.  
All stool cultures have been negative to date. Her antibiotic 
regimen was changed to Levaquin/Flagyl/Vancomycin, per GI, and 
she completed a 2 week course. Her diarrhea resolved and the 
family refused any further procedures (i.e. sigmoidoscopy).
  
2)Respiratory failure: Likely occurred secondary to aspiration 
(pt was choking) vs. mucous plugging. Patient was transferred to 
the MICU and was intubated. She is now successfully extubated 
and oxygen saturations remain stable. She was placed on a 35% FM 
to help decrease oral secretions.

3)Hypertension: Patient was placed on HCTZ and Lisinopril on 
admission and has been able to tolerate regimen well.  

4)Dementia: She was continued on Risperidone 1mg daily.
  
5)Nutrition: Patient has had difficulty taking PO since her 
admission. An NGT was placed by IR and was able to tolerated 
tube feeds well. When she was transferred to the medical floor, 
she self d/c'ed the NGT. The family decided that they wanted the 
patient to remain full code and a PEG tube was placed by IR. 

6)Code status: Given mental status and decline in patient's 
health, palliative care was consulted to address goals of care. 
Health care proxy would like patient to remain full code and as 
a result could not qualify for hospice care.

     HISTORY:  80-year-old female with distended abdomen.  Assess for impaction.
     
     No prior comparison exams are available.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Limited single portable abdominal supine radiograph.
     
     Exam is limited due to patient being nonresponsive to positioning and breath
     requests per technologist's note.
     
     Mildly prominent loops of large bowel are identified within the abdomen;
     however, the distal sigmoid and rectal region was not included on radiograph
     to assess for fecal impaction.  No small bowel dilatation is identified.
     Multiple vertebral bodies within the lower thoracic and upper lumbar spine
     appear to have lost vertebral body height, likely relating to compression
     fractures; however, full evaluation is limited on this single AP radiograph.
     Lung bases appear clear, and the aorta is tortuous.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Lack of distal sigmoid colon and rectum included on radiograph limits
     evaluation for distal impaction.  Slightly prominent loops of large bowel with
     non-dilatation of small bowel.  Recommend repeat radiograph for better
     evaluation.
     
     2.  Probable multilevel compression fractures of unclear chronicity.
     
     Findings discussed with the ordering physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 527**]. [**Last Name (STitle) 6052**], on date of exam at

     HISTORY:  80-year-old female with abdominal pain and mucoid/bloody diarrhea
     and fever.  Question ischemic colitis.
     
     Comparison is made to prior portable radiograph dated [**2912-1-1**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial acquired CT images were obtained through the abdomen and
     pelvis with oral and intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reformations
     were displayed with 5 mm slice thickness and used for better anatomic
     localization of disease.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  Limited examination of the lung
     bases displays bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right side as
     well as dependent atelectasis within the left lung base.  A calcified nodule
     is identified within the right middle lobe, likely sequela of prior
     granulomatous disease.  The right lung parenchyma displays diffuse
     interstitial thickening, which may relate to mild pulmonary edema with
     infectious etiology including aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis also included
     within the differential.  Note is made of a small pericardial effusion.  The
     liver displays multiple hypoattenuating lesions within the right lobe, some of
     which are too small to characterize but likely cystic in nature.  The largest
     within the posterior right lobe displays cystic levels on Hounsfield units and
     measures approximately 2.1 x 2.5 cm.  The gallbladder is slightly distended
     but displays no pericholecystic edema or wall enhancement and is noted to
     contain a large gallstone.  Spleen appears grossly normal.  The pancreas is
     atrophic. A feeding tube is noted within the distal duodenum, and the intra-
     abdominal small bowel appears otherwise unremarkable.  The kidneys contain
     bilateral hypoattenuating cystic lesions, the largest on the right extending
     off the upper pole measures approximately 6.5 x 6.2 cm and the largest within
     the left kidney in the interpolar region measures approximately 2.7 x 2.8 cm (
     this lesion appears to contain a small septation but is likely benign in
     nature). The adrenal glands appear unremarkable.  There are diffuse aortic
     vascular calcifications.  No pathologically enlarged retroperitoneal or
     mesenteric lymph nodes are identified.  No free air or free fluid is noted
     within the abdomen.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The rectum and distal sigmoid
     colon display diffuse symmetric wall thickening/edema with mild peri- colonic
     inflammatory changes, consistent with a nonspecific proctitis.  The remaining
                                                                 (Over)

     portion of the sigmoid colon and large bowel appears otherwise unremarkable
     with no evidence of pneumatosis.  Air is noted within a Foley containing
     urinary bladder.  The patient appears to be status post hysterectomy.  A small
     calcification is identified within the right ovary.  No pathologically
     enlarged pelvic or inguinal lymph nodes are identified.  There is a trace
     amount of free fluid noted within the pelvis.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  Patient is status post placement of dynamic compression screw
     through a right femoral fracture.  There are multilevel degenerative changes
     and degenerative disc disease within the lumbar spine as well as anterior
     wedge compression fractures of uncertain chronicity involving L2 and T11.  No
     suspicious blastic or lytic lesions are identified and there is mild
     levoscoliosis of the lumbar spine.
     
     Soft tissues display multiple calcifications within the gluteal region, likely
     representing calcified granulomas from prior injections.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Nonspecific wall edema/thickening involving the distal sigmoid colon and
     rectum, consistent with a nonspecific proctocolitis.  Differential for this
     finding includes infectious causes such as pseudomembranous colitis.  Ischemic
     colitis and inflammatory bowel disease, are felt to be less likely due to
     distribution and age of patient.  Additionally, rectal carcinoma would also be
     unlikely given the length of bowel involved.
     
     2.  Multiple hypoattenuating lesions within the liver and kidneys bilaterally,
     some of which are too small to characterize and some of which are clearly
     simple cysts in nature.
     
     3.  Bilateral pleural effusions with interstitial thickening noted within the
     right lung base, likely represents small amount of pulmonary edema.  (Early
     aspiration pneumonitis or nonfocal pneumonia are felt to be less likely).
     
     4.  Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
     
     5.  Extensive degenerative changes and lower thoracic and lumbar wedge
     compression fractures of uncertain chronicity.

     HISTORY:  80-year-old female with abdominal pain and mucoid/bloody diarrhea
     and fever.  Question ischemic colitis.
     
     Comparison is made to prior portable radiograph dated [**2912-1-1**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial acquired CT images were obtained through the abdomen and
     pelvis with oral and intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reformations
     were displayed with 5 mm slice thickness and used for better anatomic
     localization of disease.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  Limited examination of the lung
     bases displays bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right side as
     well as dependent atelectasis within the left lung base.  A calcified nodule
     is identified within the right middle lobe, likely sequela of prior
     granulomatous disease.  The right lung parenchyma displays diffuse
     interstitial thickening, which may relate to mild pulmonary edema with
     infectious etiology including aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis also included
     within the differential.  Note is made of a small pericardial effusion.  The
     liver displays multiple hypoattenuating lesions within the right lobe, some of
     which are too small to characterize but likely cystic in nature.  The largest
     within the posterior right lobe displays cystic levels on Hounsfield units and
     measures approximately 2.1 x 2.5 cm.  The gallbladder is slightly distended
     but displays no pericholecystic edema or wall enhancement and is noted to
     contain a large gallstone.  Spleen appears grossly normal.  The pancreas is
     atrophic. A feeding tube is noted within the distal duodenum, and the intra-
     abdominal small bowel appears otherwise unremarkable.  The kidneys contain
     bilateral hypoattenuating cystic lesions, the largest on the right extending
     off the upper pole measures approximately 6.5 x 6.2 cm and the largest within
     the left kidney in the interpolar region measures approximately 2.7 x 2.8 cm (
     this lesion appears to contain a small septation but is likely benign in
     nature). The adrenal glands appear unremarkable.  There are diffuse aortic
     vascular calcifications.  No pathologically enlarged retroperitoneal or
     mesenteric lymph nodes are identified.  No free air or free fluid is noted
     within the abdomen.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The rectum and distal sigmoid
     colon display diffuse symmetric wall thickening/edema with mild peri- colonic
     inflammatory changes, consistent with a nonspecific proctitis.  The remaining
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  80-year-old female with need for intravenous antibiotics, referred
     for PICC line placement.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 148**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 250**] performed the procedure.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 250**],
     the Attending Radiologist, was present and supervised.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  A preprocedure timeout was performed to verify the
     patient's identity and indication for the procedure.  The right upper arm was
     prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  Ultrasound was used to demonstrate
     patency and ease of compressibility of the right brachial vein throughout its
     course.  Approximately 2 ml of 1% lidocaine was used for local anesthesia.
     Under ultrasonographic guidance, a 21 gauge needle was advanced into the right
     brachial vein.  A 0.018 inch guidewire was then advanced through the needle to
     the level of the SVC under fluoroscopic guidance.  The needle was exchanged
     for a 4.5 French micropuncture peel-away sheath and dilator.  The dilator was
     removed and a single lumen 4 French PICC catheter was trimmed to appropriate
     length of 31 cm.  Under fluoroscopic guidance, the PICC catheter was advanced
     over the wire into the SVC.  The peel-away sheath and wire were then removed.
     A final spot fluoroscopic image demonstrates tip of the catheter in the SVC.
     Pre- and post-procedure hardcopy ultrasonographic images demonstrating patency
     of the right brachial vein were saved.  The patient tolerated the procedure
     well without immediate complication.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of 31 cm 4 French single lumen PICC catheter
     via the right brachial vein with termination in the SVC.  The line is now
     ready for use.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      80 year old woman with alzheimer's dementia, unable to take adequate PO intake  
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      PEG tube placement                                                              
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Dementia.  Swallowing disorder.  Needs long-term feeding tube for
     nutrition.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  This procedure was performed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 340**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 2339**].  Dr.
     [**First Name (STitle) 2339**], the attending radiologist, was present and supervising during the
     entire procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE:  The risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with a
     family member and the informed consent was obtained.  The preprocedure timeout
     was performed and proper identification of the patient and the procedure were
     confirmed.  Initial fluoroscopic spot image was performed and demonstrates a
     NG-tube within the stomach.  The stomach was then insufflated through the NG-
     tube.  Three T-fasteners were then sequentially placed under fluoroscopic
     guidance after local anesthesia with approximately 10 cc of 1% lidocaine.  The
     T-fasteners were deployed and the stomach wall was fixed to the anterior
     abdomen.  An 18-guage needle was then introduced into the stomach.  The
     position of the needle was confirmed with injection of approximately 4 cc of
     nonionic IV contrast.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 528**] wire was then introduced into the stomach
     through the needle.  A 7 French [**Last Name (un) 8335**] Tip sheath was then advanced over the
     wire.  Using a 5 French Kumpe catheter and the wire, we were able to advance
     the [**Last Name (un) 528**] wire within the duodenum through the pylorus.  The [**Last Name (un) 528**] wire
     was then exchanged for an Amplatz wire.  The tract in the skin was then
     dilated up to a 14 French sheath.  A 14 French [**Doctor Last Name 939**] GJ tube was then
     introduced over the wire.  The tip of the tube was placed in the fourth
     portion of the duodenum.  The retention pigtail was formed in the gastric
     antrum, deemed to be in the adequate position.  A final x-ray was obtained and
     demonstrates the tube to be in good position with the tip in the fourth
     portion of the duodenum.  The tube was then secured to the skin using 2-0
     silk.  A flexitrac device was also applied.  Patient tolerated the procedure
     well and there were no immediate complications.  Moderate sedation was
     provided, administering divided doses of Versed and fentanyl throughout the
     total in-service time of 90 minutes during which the patient's hemodynamic
     parameters were continuously monitored.  A total dose of 100 mcg of fentanyl
     and 1.5 mg of Versed were administered.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Successful placement of a 14 French [**Doctor Last Name 939**] GJ tube.  The tip of the tube
     is in the fourth portion of the duodenum.
