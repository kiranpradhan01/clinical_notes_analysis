Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2049**] 
Chief Complaint:
weakness, epigastric discomfrot
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
attempted L sided thoracentesis

 
History of Present Illness:
84 male with heavy EtOH consumption, hypothyroidism and dementia 
was admitted to an OSH on [**3395-6-4**] with 2-3 days of generalized 
weakness and epigastric discomfort. In their ED, he had melena 
and hematocrit of 21.4. His was markedly hypovolemic with Cr of 
1.8, BUN 88, SBP 95, HR:80. He never had gross bleeding but his 
Hct failed to improve with transfusion. During his admission 
there, he was transfused 12U PRBC and 4U FFP. He underwent an 
EGD twice, both times revealing large duodenal ulcer with 
overlying clot; intervention was not possible as the endoscopist 
found it difficult to keep the scope in the duodenum. On 
admission, [**6-4**], he was noted to be in NSR but ECG dated [**6-5**] 
shows him in atrial fibrillation. On the AM of transfer, he was 
noted to be mottled and cold, clammy with HR in the 150s, BPs 
160/110, tachypnic and with sats in the 70s. There was concern 
for volume overload due to multiple transfusions vs. aspiration 
pneumonia. He was intubated and given propofol for sedation; his 
BP dropped perhaps due to positive pressure ventilation vs. 
propofol. He was given neosynephrine for hypotension. He spiked 
a fever to 103.3. Tanish secretions were noted coming from ETT. 
He was placed on Zosyn but when PCN allergy was detected, he was 
changed to levofloxacin. An OG tube was placed with drainage of 
400 cc of greenish-brown material. His left AC IV was noted to 
be erythematous (?reaction to levaquin). He was given benadryl 
and the levaquin was discontinued. There was a long discussion 
with the patient's wife (his healthcare proxy) about his goal of 
care. She ""wanted to do everything possible to save his life."" 
His friends, who came to visit, however, stated that ""Mr. 
[**Name14 (STitle) 10025**] did not wish to have heroics done or any invasive 
procedures."" It was their impression that the patient's wife was 
somewhat demented. The team decided to respect the wife's 
statements as the patient's goals given that she is his proxy. 
As his neo was being infused through a peripheral IV, a right IJ 
was placed by the surgical service under sterile conditions. He 
was transferred to the MICU on [**3395-6-9**] at [**Hospital1 19**] for management of 
GI Bleed and shock.  
.  
In the [**Hospital1 19**] MICU, the right IJ was removed (based on the new 
[**Hospital1 19**] line policy that requires all lines placed at outside 
hospitals to be removed), and a left subclavian line was placed. 
He was extubated as his oxygenation and ventilation were normal. 
His neo was weaned off. GI was consulted to evaluate him. It was 
their impression that since his Hct was stable and he was known 
not to have varices that they would not perform another EGD 
here. They recommended bid IV PPI and vitamin K to reverse his 
Vitamin K deficiency (likely nutritional). The patient's WBC 
count on admission was 21 with 14% bands. He was placed on 
ceftriaxone, vanco and flagyl empirically. The bandemia rose to 
24% on [**3395-6-10**]. He remained hemodynamically stable 
post-extubation, afebrile with lactate of 1.6. Cortisol level of 
20. All blood cultures were negative, with the exception of a 
sputum culture from [**6-9**] which grew gram negative rods. A TTE was 
performed on [**6-10**] given the patient's afib, low voltage and 
transient hypotension. The LVEF was 55%, 1+MR/1+AR, LA was 
dilated. Trivial effusion. His Hct remained stable for 24 hours 
and was 28 on the day of transfer ([**6-12**]).  

 
FLOOR COURSE [**6-12**] -> TODAY  
Upon transfer, [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10026**] from social work was consulted 
regarding confusion with code status. It was determined that the 
patient's wife was stated that his wanted all measures because 
she was ""terrified that her husband would not come home to take 
care of her."" Patient also confirmed that he wished to remain 
full code and have cardioversion and be reintubated if need 
arose as he would always look forward to seeing his wife again. 
Upon arrival to the floor patient has no specific complaints and 
is very stoic. He is unclear of why he is in the hospital but he 
does know he is in [**Hospital3 **]. Alert to place, month and name. 
Remmembers family phone members, no long term memory deficits.  
.  
ROS: he DENIED any fever, chills, no n/v, no dysphagia, sore 
throat, no chest discomfort, dyspnea, no cough, he even equates 
his breathing close to his baseline, no ABD pain, no dysuria, no 
myalgias/arthralgias

.  
CXR ([**3395-6-10**]:  
Opacity in the left mid and lower lung could represent 
pneumonia.  
Small left pleural effusion persists. Left subclavian central 
venous catheter at the junction of the brachiocephalic vein and 
superior vena cava.  
.  
ECHO [**3395-6-10**]  
1. The left atrium is markedly dilated. The left atrium is 
elongated. The right atrium is moderately dilated.  
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left 
ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical 
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully 
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic  
function is normal (LVEF>55%).  
3.Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular 
systolic function is normal.  
4.The aortic root is mildly dilated.  
5.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) 
aortic  
regurgitation is seen.  
6.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) 
mitral  
regurgitation is seen.  
7.Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.  
8. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  
9.There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.  
.
CT [**6-13**]:
CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The heart is top normal in 
size with extensive coronary artery calcifications. There are 
mural calcifications of the aortic arch. Multiple small lymph[**MD Number 761**] of the mediastinum are present in the paratracheal, 
pretracheal and aorticopulmonary window regions measuring up to 
12 mm maximum. There is no axillary lymphadenopathy. There is 
extensive consolidation of the left lower lobe as well as 
lingula and apex of the left upper lobe with associated air 
bronchograms consistent with pneumonia. There are large 
bilateral pleural effusions with associated bilateral lower lobe 
posterobasal atelectasis. Consolidation and air bronchograms of 
the posterior right lower lobe are likely due to atelectasis. 
Fluid also tracks into the fissures and peripheral interlobular 
septae bilaterally. There are wedge- shaped pleural-based 
opacities of the right middle and right upper lobes which are 
likely inflammatory, possibly spread of pneumonia, infarcts are 
much less likely. There are multiple small bilateral apical 
blebs. No pneumothorax. Limited evaluation of the abdomen 
demonstrates an atrophic appearing pancreas but otherwise 
unremarkable limited views of the liver, spleen, adrenal glands, 
and kidneys.

BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions 
are identified. There are degenerative changes of the thoracic 
spine including anterior osteophyte formation.

IMPRESSION:
1. Multifocal pneumonia of the left lower lobe, lingula, and 
left upper lobe.
Two small wedge-shaped pleural-based opacities of the right 
upper and middle lobes may represent spread of pneumonia.
2. Moderate bilateral layering pleural effusions with associated 
posterobasal atelectasis of the lower lobes bilaterally.
3. Probable component of congestive heart failure given pleural 
effusions, fissural fluid, and interstitial prominence.
4. Multiple small bilateral apical blebs.
.
CXR [**6-15**]:
CHEST: The left subclavian line has been removed. The asymmetric 
interstitial [**Doctor Last Name 9850**] present on the prior chest x-ray is again 
seen and allowing for differences in penetration it is not 
significantly changed. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle 
is present. No pneumothorax is identified on this side.

IMPRESSION: No pneumothorax. No significant change in chest 
appearance.

ASSIST/CON INTUBATED   
 
Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 85 male with chronic EtOH use transferred from OSH to MICU 
with UGIB, shock, and respiratory failure, now much improved 
being transferred to medical floor for further management  
.  
1) GI Bleed- 
Pt w/EGD X 2 @ OSH showing likely source as duodenal ulcer.   It 
was felt that there was no indication for repeat intervention as 
patient's Hct remained stable.   His last transfusion was before 
arrival to [**Hospital1 19**] on [**6-9**].   His discharge Hct is 28.8 and he 
appears to have settled in that range.  Patient is to continue 
on Protonix BID in the meantime for his ulcer.  He is to avoid 
any anticoagulation for his afib.  He may require a repeat EGD 
if his Hct starts to drop or if he experiences hematemesis.
.  
2) Hypotension/Shock - Now resolved. Most likely etiology was 
sepsis given bandemia with pneumonia as seen with lung 
infiltrates.  +/- hypovolemia due to blood loss. Patient 
subsequently with hypertension.  Patient underwent cortisol stim 
test and it was norm la, there was no evidence of adrenal 
insufficiency.  Patient's BCx remained negative while in house.  
His UCx was unremarkable as well.  Patient finished 7 day course 
of IV CTX/Flagyl while in house.  He is to complete 5 days more 
of Levoquin/Flagyl PO.  
.
3) Hypoxia -
Pneumonia -
Patient was found to have Klebsiella on sputum on [**6-9**] that was 
pan-sensitive.  A CT done on [**6-13**] showed multilobular PNA that 
was treated with 7 days of IV CTX/Flagyl.  Patient is to 
complete another 5 day course of Levofloxacin at acute rehab.  
Interventional Pulmonary service was consulted in house to 
attempt a diagnostic/therapeutic thoracentesis.  The effusion 
was visualized with US and a tap was attempted.  No fluid was 
extracted.  The procedure was without complication.  Follow up 
CXR was without pneumothorax.  Patient remained afebrile since 
after his d/c from ICU on [**6-12**] and his WBC remained normal.
.
? diastolic CHF - patient with E/E' <8, thus suggesting PCWP 
<12, and EF > 55%, but patient does have 55%.  Patient was 
attempted at diuresis as his CT appeared to have b/l pleural 
effusions and he was given prn IV lasix (20-40) prior to 
discharge with good UO.  
.
Patient is sating 95%+ on 2L at the time of discharge.  However 
desats quickly with little movement. 
- He would certainly benefit from pulmonary reevaluation at the 
end of his antibiotic course as his treatment course may need to 
be extended for this complicated multilobar pneumonia. Continued 
diuresis and rate control for chf will also likely be helpful. 
.  
3) Afib- Appears new and likely secondary to medical conditions. 
Large atrial size suggests that it will most definitely be 
recurrent. Patient tolerated low dose BB well and remained well 
controlled with rate in 50-60s. 
.  
4) R shoulder pain - patient states the pain has been there for 
last few years.  CXR here showed no evidence of fracture, with 
some suggestion of OA changes.  The high riding humerus may 
suggest an underlying chronic rotator cuff injury that should 
perhaps be further evaluated by an orthopedic specialist - 
nonacutely.
- tylenol/oxycodone for pain
.
5) EtOH use:  no evidence of withdrawal despite use of 2-3 
drinks a day.
>>> d/c CIWA scale as patient with neglible scores, likely out 
of window. Received versed (benzo) in MICU which may confound 
the withdrawal period.  
.  
7) Hypothyroid:  
>>> continue synthroid 50 mcg QD  
>>> TSH - nl  
.  
8) FEN- clear diet- ADAT; pt continue on thin liquids and 
regular consistency
solids. 

.  
9) CODE/COMM: d/w patient who appears competent and he wishes to 
be FULL CODE.  His wife confirmed his wishes.  After speaking to 
family's caretaker, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10032**] it appears that the situation 
should be readressed where Mr. [**Known patient lastname 10029**] to remain

     pneumonia, question effusions.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  AP semi-upright portable chest radiograph.
     
     No prior studies are available for comparison purposes on PACS.
     
     FINDINGS:  An NG tube is located with the tip approximately 2 cm above the
     carina.  Retraction of approximately 2 cm is recommended.  An NG tube is seen
     coursing over the stomach, the tip is not included in the study.  A right
     internal jugular venous central catheter is seen with the tip projecting over
     the distal SVC.  The size of the cardiac silhouette is within normal limits
     given technique.  Mediastinal contours are unremarkable. There is a hazy
     opacity over the left lung which may represent a layering pleural effusion.
     The left costophrenic angle is not included in the study. There may be a very
     small right-sided pleural effusion as well.  No definite consolidations are
     seen. There are degenerative changes in the right glenohumeral joint.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  ETT 2 cm above carina.  Retraction of approximately 2 cm is recommended.

     COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from [**3395-6-9**].
     
     SINGLE PORTABLE AP SUPINE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There has been interval placement
     of a left subclavian central venous catheter with its tip terminating at the
     junction of the left brachiocephalic vein and the superior vena cava.  There
     is a right internal jugular central venous catheter with its tip in the mid
     superior vena cava.  There appears to have been interval extubation and
     removal of a nasogastric tube.  The patient is rotated, but given this
     limitation, the cardiac and mediastinal contours appear stable.  There is an
     opacity in the mid and lower left lung which is more prominent than on the
     prior study.  There also appears to be a small left pleural effusion.  No
     pneumothoraces are clearly identified.

     HISTORY:  85-year-old male with pneumonia and pleural effusions.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT continuously acquired axial images of the chest were obtained
     without IV contrast.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  The heart is top normal in size with
     extensive coronary artery calcifications.  There are mural calcifications of
     the aortic arch.  Multiple small lymph nodes of the mediastinum are present in
     the paratracheal, pretracheal and aorticopulmonary window regions measuring up
     to 12 mm maximum.  There is no axillary lymphadenopathy.  There is extensive
     consolidation of the left lower lobe as well as lingula and apex of the left
     upper lobe with associated air bronchograms consistent with pneumonia.  There
     are large bilateral pleural effusions with associated bilateral lower lobe
     posterobasal atelectasis. Consolidation and air bronchograms of the posterior
     right lower lobe are likely due to atelectasis.  Fluid also tracks into the
     fissures and peripheral interlobular septae bilaterally. There are wedge-
     shaped pleural-based opacities of the right middle and right upper lobes which
     are likely inflammatory, possibly spread of pneumonia, infarcts are much less
     likely. There are multiple small bilateral apical blebs.  No pneumothorax.
     Limited evaluation of the abdomen demonstrates an atrophic appearing pancreas
     but otherwise unremarkable limited views of the liver, spleen, adrenal glands,
     and kidneys.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions are
     identified.  There are degenerative changes of the thoracic spine including
     anterior osteophyte formation.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Multifocal pneumonia of the left lower lobe, lingula, and left upper lobe.
     Two small wedge-shaped pleural-based opacities of the right upper and middle
     lobes may represent spread of pneumonia.
     2.  Moderate bilateral layering pleural effusions with associated posterobasal
     atelectasis of the lower lobes bilaterally.
     3.  Probable component of congestive heart failure given pleural effusions,
     fissural fluid, and interstitial prominence.
     4.  Multiple small bilateral apical blebs.
                                                                 (Over)

     An asymmetrical alveolar process involving the left lung diffusely with
     relative sparing of the apex, and involving the right lower lobe posteriorly
     in the retrocardiac region shows slight interval improvement, and likely
     reflects an improving multifocal pneumonia, particularly in conjunction with
     the appearance of the opacities on recent CT of [**3395-6-13**].  Small left
     pleural effusion has not changed appreciably.  Right pleural effusion is
     difficult to assess due to exclusion of the right costophrenic sulcus from the
     radiograph.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      85 year old man with GI bleed and known duodenal ulcer on EGD last week at OSH. 
      EGD here on [**6-17**] was unsuccessful, unable to pass scope into stomach.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      pls evaluate GI bleed for embolization                                          
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  85-year-old man with GI bleed and known duodenal ulcer on upper
     endoscopy at an outside institution.  The duodenal ulcer was unable to be
     treated by endoscopy by report.  Upper endoscopy was attempted here but was
     unsuccessful passing the scope beyond the cervical esophagus.
     
     PHYSICIANS:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 620**] [**Doctor Last Name 621**] and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1983**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2281**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2281**], the attending
     radiologist, present and supervising throughout the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Following written informed consent with the patient's daughter and
     son-in-law, the patient was positioned supine on the angiography table.
     Preprocedure timeout was performed to confirm patient, procedure and site.
     Standard sterile prep and drape of the right inguinal region.  Local
     anesthesia with 7 cc of 1% lidocaine subcutaneously.  Using a combination of
     palpatory and fluoroscopic guidance, a single wall puncture of the right
     common femoral artery was performed.  A 0.035-inch guidewire was advanced
     through the needle into the abdominal aorta using fluoroscopic guidance.
     Needle was exchanged for a 5-French vascular sheath, however, due to marked
     tortuosity of the iliac arteries this did not provide adequate stability for
     catheter manipulations in the aorta.  As such, the sheath was exchanged for a
     long 6-French vascular sheath.  A cobra catheter was used to select the
     superior mesenteric artery and superior mesenteric arteriography was
     performed.  Attempts were made to catheterize the celiac artery with cobra
     catheter, Sos Omni catheter, [**Doctor Last Name 2272**] catheter, but these were all
     unsuccessful.  Finally, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5790**] catheter was successful at selecting the
     celiac artery.  Celiac arteriography was performed.  Based on the patient's
                                                                 (Over)

     clinical presentation and the findings of the diagnostic arteriograms, it was
     determined that the patient was a suitable candidate for and may benefit from
     embolization of the gastroduodenal artery.  A 3-French microcatheter was
     advanced with a 0.018-inch guidewire through the [**Last Name (un) 5790**] catheter and used
     to select the gastroduodenal artery.  Gastroduodenal arteriography was
     performed.  Coil embolization of the gastroduodenal artery was then performed
     through the microcatheter using a total of four 2 mm x 2 cm microcoils and
     four 4 mm x 4 cm microcoils.  The catheter was displaced into the common
     hepatic artery and common hepatic arteriography was performed post-
     embolization.  Based on the findings of this post-embolization arteriogram, we
     attempted to regain access to the proximal stump of the gastroduodenal artery,
     however, these attempts were unsuccessful.  All catheters, wires, and the
     sheath were removed and hemostasis was ensured with direct manual compression.
     
     There were no immediate complications.
     
     Moderate sedation was provided by administering divided doses of intravenous
     Versed (total of 2 mg) and intravenous fentanyl (total of 200 mcg).  There was
     a total intraservice time of 2 hours, during which the patient's hemodynamic
     parameters were continuously monitored.
     
     Total of 150 cc of Optiray radiographic contrast was utilized.
     
     FINDINGS:  Superior mesenteric arteriography demonstrated patency of the
     superior mesenteric artery and its major branches.  A replaced right hepatic
     artery arises from the proximal portion of the superior mesenteric artery.  No
     source of bleeding or active extravasation was identified in the visualized
     portions of the superior mesenteric artery territory.
     
     Celiac arteriography demonstrates the splenic artery, left gastric artery and
     common hepatic artery to arise from the celiac artery.  The left hepatic
     artery arises from the common hepatic artery.  The gastroduodenal artery
     arises from the common hepatic artery.  The celiac artery and its major
     branches are patent.  Active extravasation or potential source of bleeding
     from the celiac artery territory was not identified.  The imaging was carried
     out into the venous phase and the splenic vein, main and right and left main
     portal veins are patent.
     
     Gastroduodenal arteriography demonstrates patency of the right gastroepiploic
     artery and the superior pancreaticoduodenal arteries.
     
     Common hepatic arteriography post-embolization demonstrates ongoing patency of
     the downstream portion of the common hepatic artery and the left hepatic
     artery.  The proximal stump of the gastroduodenal artery is patent.  The coil
     embolization was performed from the origin of the gastroepiploic artery back
                                                                 (Over)

     to near the origin of the gastroduodenal artery.  On this arteriogram, a small
     branch arising from the proximal gastroduodenal artery was still perfused.
     Attempts to reenter the gastroduodenal artery stump to embolize this branch
     were unsuccessful.
     
     There were no immediate complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No arterial source of bleeding identified on celiac arteriography
     and superior mesenteric arteriography (with imaging focused on the superior
     half of the bowel).  Based on the history of a duodenal ulcer with blood clot
     at a prior upper endoscopy at an outside hospital and the findings of the
     diagnostic arteriograms, it was determined that the patient may benefit from
     and was a suitable candidate for gastroduodenal artery embolization.  This was
     performed with a residual small branch of the proximal gastroduodenal artery
     not occluded.  At the time of the final angiographic run, there was still some
     perfusion through the superior coils into another branch of the gastroduodenal
     artery as well.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      85 year old man with GI bleed and known duodenal ulcer on EGD last week at OSH. 
      EGD here on [**6-17**] was unsuccessful, unable to pass scope into stomach.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      pls evaluate GI bleed for embolization                                          
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  85-year-old man with GI bleed and known duodenal ulcer on upper
     endoscopy at an outside institution.  The duodenal ulcer was unable to be
     treated by endoscopy by report.  Upper endoscopy was attempted here but was
     unsuccessful passing the scope beyond the cervical esophagus.
     
     PHYSICIANS:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 620**] [**Doctor Last Name 621**] and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1983**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2281**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2281**], the attending
     radiologist, present and supervising throughout the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Following written informed consent with the patient's daughter and
     son-in-law, the patient was positioned supine on the angiography table.
     Preprocedure timeout was performed to confirm patient, procedure and site.
     Standard sterile prep and drape of the right inguinal region.  Local
     anesthesia with 7 cc of 1% lidocaine subcutaneously.  Using a combination of
     palpatory and fluoroscopic guidance, a single wall puncture of the right
     common femoral artery was performed.  A 0.035-inch guidewire was advanced
     through the needle into the abdominal aorta using fluoroscopic guidance.
     Needle was exchanged for a 5-French vascular sheath, however, due to marked
     tortuosity of the iliac arteries this did not provide adequate stability for
     catheter manipulations in the aorta.  As such, the sheath was exchanged for a
     long 6-French vascular sheath.  A cobra catheter was used to select the
     superior mesenteric artery and superior mesenteric arteriography was
     performed.  Attempts were made to catheterize the celiac artery with cobra
     catheter, Sos Omni catheter, [**Doctor Last Name 2272**] catheter, but these were all
     unsuccessful.  Finally, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5790**] catheter was successful at selecting the
     celiac artery.  Celiac arteriography was performed.  Based on the patient's
                                                                 (Over)

     clinical presentation and the findings of the diagnostic arteriograms, it was
     determined that the patient was a suitable candidate for and may benefit from
     embolization of the gastroduodenal artery.  A 3-French microcatheter was
     advanced with a 0.018-inch guidewire through the [**Last Name (un) 5790**] catheter and used
     to select the gastroduodenal artery.  Gastroduodenal arteriography was
     performed.  Coil embolization of the gastroduodenal artery was then performed
     through the microcatheter using a total of four 2 mm x 2 cm microcoils and
     four 4 mm x 4 cm microcoils.  The catheter was displaced into the common
     hepatic artery and common hepatic arteriography was performed post-
     embolization.  Based on the findings of this post-embolization arteriogram, we
     attempted to regain access to the proximal stump of the gastroduodenal artery,
     however, these attempts were unsuccessful.  All catheters, wires, and the
     sheath were removed and hemostasis was ensured with direct manual compression.
     
     There were no immediate complications.
     
     Moderate sedation was provided by administering divided doses of intravenous
     Versed (total of 2 mg) and intravenous fentanyl (total of 200 mcg).  There was
     a total intraservice time of 2 hours, during which the patient's hemodynamic
     parameters were continuously monitored.
     
     Total of 150 cc of Optiray radiographic contrast was utilized.
     
     FINDINGS:  Superior mesenteric arteriography demonstrated patency of the
     superior mesenteric artery and its major branches.  A replaced right hepatic
     artery arises from the proximal portion of the superior mesenteric artery.  No
     source of bleeding or active extravasation was identified in the visualized
     portions of the superior mesenteric artery territory.
     
     Celiac arteriography demonstrates the splenic artery, left gastric artery and
     common hepatic artery to arise from the celiac artery.  The left hepatic
     artery arises from the common hepatic artery.  The gastroduodenal artery
     arises from the common hepatic artery.  The celiac artery and its major
     branches are patent.  Active extravasation or potential source of bleeding
     from the celiac artery territory was not identified.  The imaging was carried
     out into the venous phase and the splenic vein, main and right and left main
     portal veins are patent.
     
     Gastroduodenal arteriography demonstrates patency of the right gastroepiploic
     artery and the superior pancreaticoduodenal arteries.
     
     Common hepatic arteriography post-embolization demonstrates ongoing patency of
     the downstream portion of the common hepatic artery and the left hepatic
     artery.  The proximal stump of the gastroduodenal artery is patent.  The coil
     embolization was performed from the origin of the gastroepiploic artery back
                                                                 (Over)

     to near the origin of the gastroduodenal artery.  On this arteriogram, a small
     branch arising from the proximal gastroduodenal artery was still perfused.
     Attempts to reenter the gastroduodenal artery stump to embolize this branch
     were unsuccessful.
     
     There were no immediate complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No arterial source of bleeding identified on celiac arteriography
     and superior mesenteric arteriography (with imaging focused on the superior
     half of the bowel).  Based on the history of a duodenal ulcer with blood clot
     at a prior upper endoscopy at an outside hospital and the findings of the
     diagnostic arteriograms, it was determined that the patient may benefit from
     and was a suitable candidate for gastroduodenal artery embolization.  This was
     performed with a residual small branch of the proximal gastroduodenal artery
     not occluded.  At the time of the final angiographic run, there was still some
     perfusion through the superior coils into another branch of the gastroduodenal
     artery as well.

     clinical presentation and the findings of the diagnostic arteriograms, it was
     determined that the patient was a suitable candidate for and may benefit from
     embolization of the gastroduodenal artery.  A 3-French microcatheter was
     advanced with a 0.018-inch guidewire through the [**Last Name (un) 5790**] catheter and used
     to select the gastroduodenal artery.  Gastroduodenal arteriography was
     performed.  Coil embolization of the gastroduodenal artery was then performed
     through the microcatheter using a total of four 2 mm x 2 cm microcoils and
     four 4 mm x 4 cm microcoils.  The catheter was displaced into the common
     hepatic artery and common hepatic arteriography was performed post-
     embolization.  Based on the findings of this post-embolization arteriogram, we
     attempted to regain access to the proximal stump of the gastroduodenal artery,
     however, these attempts were unsuccessful.  All catheters, wires, and the
     sheath were removed and hemostasis was ensured with direct manual compression.
     
     There were no immediate complications.
     
     Moderate sedation was provided by administering divided doses of intravenous
     Versed (total of 2 mg) and intravenous fentanyl (total of 200 mcg).  There was
     a total intraservice time of 2 hours, during which the patient's hemodynamic
     parameters were continuously monitored.
     
     Total of 150 cc of Optiray radiographic contrast was utilized.
     
     FINDINGS:  Superior mesenteric arteriography demonstrated patency of the
     superior mesenteric artery and its major branches.  A replaced right hepatic
     artery arises from the proximal portion of the superior mesenteric artery.  No
     source of bleeding or active extravasation was identified in the visualized
     portions of the superior mesenteric artery territory.
     
     Celiac arteriography demonstrates the splenic artery, left gastric artery and
     common hepatic artery to arise from the celiac artery.  The left hepatic
     artery arises from the common hepatic artery.  The gastroduodenal artery
     arises from the common hepatic artery.  The celiac artery and its major
     branches are patent.  Active extravasation or potential source of bleeding
     from the celiac artery territory was not identified.  The imaging was carried
     out into the venous phase and the splenic vein, main and right and left main
     portal veins are patent.
     
     Gastroduodenal arteriography demonstrates patency of the right gastroepiploic
     artery and the superior pancreaticoduodenal arteries.
     
     Common hepatic arteriography post-embolization demonstrates ongoing patency of
     the downstream portion of the common hepatic artery and the left hepatic
     artery.  The proximal stump of the gastroduodenal artery is patent.  The coil
     embolization was performed from the origin of the gastroepiploic artery back
                                                                 (Over)

     to near the origin of the gastroduodenal artery.  On this arteriogram, a small
     branch arising from the proximal gastroduodenal artery was still perfused.
     Attempts to reenter the gastroduodenal artery stump to embolize this branch
     were unsuccessful.
     
     There were no immediate complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No arterial source of bleeding identified on celiac arteriography
     and superior mesenteric arteriography (with imaging focused on the superior
     half of the bowel).  Based on the history of a duodenal ulcer with blood clot
     at a prior upper endoscopy at an outside hospital and the findings of the
     diagnostic arteriograms, it was determined that the patient may benefit from
     and was a suitable candidate for gastroduodenal artery embolization.  This was
     performed with a residual small branch of the proximal gastroduodenal artery
     not occluded.  At the time of the final angiographic run, there was still some
     perfusion through the superior coils into another branch of the gastroduodenal
     artery as well.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      85 year old man with GI bleed and known duodenal ulcer on EGD last week at OSH. 
      EGD here on [**6-17**] was unsuccessful, unable to pass scope into stomach.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      pls evaluate GI bleed for embolization

     HISTORY:  85-year-old man with GI bleed and known duodenal ulcer on upper
     endoscopy at an outside institution.  The duodenal ulcer was unable to be
     treated by endoscopy by report.  Upper endoscopy was attempted here but was
     unsuccessful passing the scope beyond the cervical esophagus.
     
     PHYSICIANS:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 620**] [**Doctor Last Name 621**] and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1983**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2281**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2281**], the attending
     radiologist, present and supervising throughout the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Following written informed consent with the patient's daughter and
     son-in-law, the patient was positioned supine on the angiography table.
     Preprocedure timeout was performed to confirm patient, procedure and site.
     Standard sterile prep and drape of the right inguinal region.  Local
     anesthesia with 7 cc of 1% lidocaine subcutaneously.  Using a combination of
     palpatory and fluoroscopic guidance, a single wall puncture of the right
     common femoral artery was performed.  A 0.035-inch guidewire was advanced
     through the needle into the abdominal aorta using fluoroscopic guidance.
     Needle was exchanged for a 5-French vascular sheath, however, due to marked
     tortuosity of the iliac arteries this did not provide adequate stability for
     catheter manipulations in the aorta.  As such, the sheath was exchanged for a
     long 6-French vascular sheath.  A cobra catheter was used to select the
     superior mesenteric artery and superior mesenteric arteriography was
     performed.  Attempts were made to catheterize the celiac artery with cobra
     catheter, Sos Omni catheter, [**Doctor Last Name 2272**] catheter, but these were all
     unsuccessful.  Finally, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5790**] catheter was successful at selecting the
     celiac artery.  Celiac arteriography was performed.  Based on the patient's
                                                                 (Over)

     four 4 mm x 4 cm microcoils.  The catheter was displaced into the common
     hepatic artery and common hepatic arteriography was performed post-
     embolization.  Based on the findings of this post-embolization arteriogram, we
     attempted to regain access to the proximal stump of the gastroduodenal artery,
     however, these attempts were unsuccessful.  All catheters, wires, and the

     a total intraservice time of 2 hours, during which the patient's hemodynamic
     parameters were continuously monitored.
     
     Total of 150 cc of Optiray radiographic contrast was utilized.

     superior mesenteric artery and its major branches.  A replaced right hepatic
     artery arises from the proximal portion of the superior mesenteric artery.  No
     source of bleeding or active extravasation was identified in the visualized

     branches are patent.  Active extravasation or potential source of bleeding
     from the celiac artery territory was not identified.  The imaging was carried
     out into the venous phase and the splenic vein, main and right and left main
     portal veins are patent.
     
     Gastroduodenal arteriography demonstrates patency of the right gastroepiploic
     artery and the superior pancreaticoduodenal arteries.
     
     Common hepatic arteriography post-embolization demonstrates ongoing patency of
     the downstream portion of the common hepatic artery and the left hepatic

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      85 year old man with GI bleed and known duodenal ulcer on EGD last week at OSH. 
      EGD here on [**6-17**] was unsuccessful, unable to pass scope into stomach.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      pls evaluate GI bleed for embolization                                          
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  85-year-old man with GI bleed and known duodenal ulcer on upper
     endoscopy at an outside institution.  The duodenal ulcer was unable to be
     treated by endoscopy by report.  Upper endoscopy was attempted here but was
     unsuccessful passing the scope beyond the cervical esophagus.
     
     PHYSICIANS:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 620**] [**Doctor Last Name 621**] and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1983**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2281**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2281**], the attending
     radiologist, present and supervising throughout the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Following written informed consent with the patient's daughter and
     son-in-law, the patient was positioned supine on the angiography table.
     Preprocedure timeout was performed to confirm patient, procedure and site.
     Standard sterile prep and drape of the right inguinal region.  Local
     anesthesia with 7 cc of 1% lidocaine subcutaneously.  Using a combination of
     palpatory and fluoroscopic guidance, a single wall puncture of the right
     common femoral artery was performed.  A 0.035-inch guidewire was advanced
     through the needle into the abdominal aorta using fluoroscopic guidance.
     Needle was exchanged for a 5-French vascular sheath, however, due to marked
     tortuosity of the iliac arteries this did not provide adequate stability for
     catheter manipulations in the aorta.  As such, the sheath was exchanged for a
     long 6-French vascular sheath.  A cobra catheter was used to select the
     superior mesenteric artery and superior mesenteric arteriography was
     performed.  Attempts were made to catheterize the celiac artery with cobra
     catheter, Sos Omni catheter, [**Doctor Last Name 2272**] catheter, but these were all
     unsuccessful.  Finally, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5790**] catheter was successful at selecting the
     celiac artery.  Celiac arteriography was performed.  Based on the patient's
                                                                 (Over)

     clinical presentation and the findings of the diagnostic arteriograms, it was
     determined that the patient was a suitable candidate for and may benefit from
     embolization of the gastroduodenal artery.  A 3-French microcatheter was
     advanced with a 0.018-inch guidewire through the [**Last Name (un) 5790**] catheter and used
     to select the gastroduodenal artery.  Gastroduodenal arteriography was
     performed.  Coil embolization of the gastroduodenal artery was then performed
     through the microcatheter using a total of four 2 mm x 2 cm microcoils and
     four 4 mm x 4 cm microcoils.  The catheter was displaced into the common
     hepatic artery and common hepatic arteriography was performed post-
     embolization.  Based on the findings of this post-embolization arteriogram, we
     attempted to regain access to the proximal stump of the gastroduodenal artery,
     however, these attempts were unsuccessful.  All catheters, wires, and the
     sheath were removed and hemostasis was ensured with direct manual compression.
     
     There were no immediate complications.
     
     Moderate sedation was provided by administering divided doses of intravenous
     Versed (total of 2 mg) and intravenous fentanyl (total of 200 mcg).  There was
     a total intraservice time of 2 hours, during which the patient's hemodynamic
     parameters were continuously monitored.
     
     Total of 150 cc of Optiray radiographic contrast was utilized.
     
     FINDINGS:  Superior mesenteric arteriography demonstrated patency of the
     superior mesenteric artery and its major branches.  A replaced right hepatic
     artery arises from the proximal portion of the superior mesenteric artery.  No
     source of bleeding or active extravasation was identified in the visualized
     portions of the superior mesenteric artery territory.
     
     Celiac arteriography demonstrates the splenic artery, left gastric artery and
     common hepatic artery to arise from the celiac artery.  The left hepatic
     artery arises from the common hepatic artery.  The gastroduodenal artery
     arises from the common hepatic artery.  The celiac artery and its major
     branches are patent.  Active extravasation or potential source of bleeding
     from the celiac artery territory was not identified.  The imaging was carried
     out into the venous phase and the splenic vein, main and right and left main
     portal veins are patent.
     
     Gastroduodenal arteriography demonstrates patency of the right gastroepiploic
     artery and the superior pancreaticoduodenal arteries.
     
     Common hepatic arteriography post-embolization demonstrates ongoing patency of
     the downstream portion of the common hepatic artery and the left hepatic
     artery.  The proximal stump of the gastroduodenal artery is patent.  The coil
     embolization was performed from the origin of the gastroepiploic artery back
                                                                 (Over)

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      85 year old man with GI bleed and known duodenal ulcer on EGD last week at OSH. 
      EGD here on [**6-17**] was unsuccessful, unable to pass scope into stomach.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      pls evaluate GI bleed for embolization                                          
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  85-year-old man with GI bleed and known duodenal ulcer on upper
     endoscopy at an outside institution.  The duodenal ulcer was unable to be
     treated by endoscopy by report.  Upper endoscopy was attempted here but was
     unsuccessful passing the scope beyond the cervical esophagus.
     
     PHYSICIANS:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 620**] [**Doctor Last Name 621**] and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1983**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2281**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2281**], the attending
     radiologist, present and supervising throughout the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Following written informed consent with the patient's daughter and
     son-in-law, the patient was positioned supine on the angiography table.
     Preprocedure timeout was performed to confirm patient, procedure and site.
     Standard sterile prep and drape of the right inguinal region.  Local
     anesthesia with 7 cc of 1% lidocaine subcutaneously.  Using a combination of
     palpatory and fluoroscopic guidance, a single wall puncture of the right
     common femoral artery was performed.  A 0.035-inch guidewire was advanced
     through the needle into the abdominal aorta using fluoroscopic guidance.
     Needle was exchanged for a 5-French vascular sheath, however, due to marked
     tortuosity of the iliac arteries this did not provide adequate stability for
     catheter manipulations in the aorta.  As such, the sheath was exchanged for a
     long 6-French vascular sheath.  A cobra catheter was used to select the
     superior mesenteric artery and superior mesenteric arteriography was
     performed.  Attempts were made to catheterize the celiac artery with cobra
     catheter, Sos Omni catheter, [**Doctor Last Name 2272**] catheter, but these were all
     unsuccessful.  Finally, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5790**] catheter was successful at selecting the
     celiac artery.  Celiac arteriography was performed.  Based on the patient's
                                                                 (Over)

     clinical presentation and the findings of the diagnostic arteriograms, it was
     determined that the patient was a suitable candidate for and may benefit from
     embolization of the gastroduodenal artery.  A 3-French microcatheter was
     advanced with a 0.018-inch guidewire through the [**Last Name (un) 5790**] catheter and used
     to select the gastroduodenal artery.  Gastroduodenal arteriography was
     performed.  Coil embolization of the gastroduodenal artery was then performed
     through the microcatheter using a total of four 2 mm x 2 cm microcoils and
     four 4 mm x 4 cm microcoils.  The catheter was displaced into the common
     hepatic artery and common hepatic arteriography was performed post-
     embolization.  Based on the findings of this post-embolization arteriogram, we
     attempted to regain access to the proximal stump of the gastroduodenal artery,
     however, these attempts were unsuccessful.  All catheters, wires, and the
     sheath were removed and hemostasis was ensured with direct manual compression.
     
     There were no immediate complications.
     
     Moderate sedation was provided by administering divided doses of intravenous
     Versed (total of 2 mg) and intravenous fentanyl (total of 200 mcg).  There was
     a total intraservice time of 2 hours, during which the patient's hemodynamic
     parameters were continuously monitored.
     
     Total of 150 cc of Optiray radiographic contrast was utilized.
     
     FINDINGS:  Superior mesenteric arteriography demonstrated patency of the
     superior mesenteric artery and its major branches.  A replaced right hepatic
     artery arises from the proximal portion of the superior mesenteric artery.  No
     source of bleeding or active extravasation was identified in the visualized
     portions of the superior mesenteric artery territory.
     
     Celiac arteriography demonstrates the splenic artery, left gastric artery and
     common hepatic artery to arise from the celiac artery.  The left hepatic
     artery arises from the common hepatic artery.  The gastroduodenal artery
     arises from the common hepatic artery.  The celiac artery and its major
     branches are patent.  Active extravasation or potential source of bleeding
     from the celiac artery territory was not identified.  The imaging was carried
     out into the venous phase and the splenic vein, main and right and left main
     portal veins are patent.
     
     Gastroduodenal arteriography demonstrates patency of the right gastroepiploic
     artery and the superior pancreaticoduodenal arteries.
     
     Common hepatic arteriography post-embolization demonstrates ongoing patency of
     the downstream portion of the common hepatic artery and the left hepatic
     artery.  The proximal stump of the gastroduodenal artery is patent.  The coil
     embolization was performed from the origin of the gastroepiploic artery back
                                                                 (Over)

     to near the origin of the gastroduodenal artery.  On this arteriogram, a small
     branch arising from the proximal gastroduodenal artery was still perfused.
     Attempts to reenter the gastroduodenal artery stump to embolize this branch
     were unsuccessful.
     
     There were no immediate complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No arterial source of bleeding identified on celiac arteriography
     and superior mesenteric arteriography (with imaging focused on the superior
     half of the bowel).  Based on the history of a duodenal ulcer with blood clot
     at a prior upper endoscopy at an outside hospital and the findings of the
     diagnostic arteriograms, it was determined that the patient may benefit from
     and was a suitable candidate for gastroduodenal artery embolization.  This was
     performed with a residual small branch of the proximal gastroduodenal artery
     not occluded.  At the time of the final angiographic run, there was still some
     perfusion through the superior coils into another branch of the gastroduodenal
     artery as well.

     clinical presentation and the findings of the diagnostic arteriograms, it was
     determined that the patient was a suitable candidate for and may benefit from
     embolization of the gastroduodenal artery.  A 3-French microcatheter was
     advanced with a 0.018-inch guidewire through the [**Last Name (un) 5790**] catheter and used
     to select the gastroduodenal artery.  Gastroduodenal arteriography was
     performed.  Coil embolization of the gastroduodenal artery was then performed
     through the microcatheter using a total of four 2 mm x 2 cm microcoils and
     four 4 mm x 4 cm microcoils.  The catheter was displaced into the common
     hepatic artery and common hepatic arteriography was performed post-
     embolization.  Based on the findings of this post-embolization arteriogram, we
     attempted to regain access to the proximal stump of the gastroduodenal artery,
     however, these attempts were unsuccessful.  All catheters, wires, and the
     sheath were removed and hemostasis was ensured with direct manual compression.
     
     There were no immediate complications.
     
     Moderate sedation was provided by administering divided doses of intravenous
     Versed (total of 2 mg) and intravenous fentanyl (total of 200 mcg).  There was
     a total intraservice time of 2 hours, during which the patient's hemodynamic
     parameters were continuously monitored.
     
     Total of 150 cc of Optiray radiographic contrast was utilized.
     
     FINDINGS:  Superior mesenteric arteriography demonstrated patency of the
     superior mesenteric artery and its major branches.  A replaced right hepatic
     artery arises from the proximal portion of the superior mesenteric artery.  No
     source of bleeding or active extravasation was identified in the visualized
     portions of the superior mesenteric artery territory.
     
     Celiac arteriography demonstrates the splenic artery, left gastric artery and
     common hepatic artery to arise from the celiac artery.  The left hepatic
     artery arises from the common hepatic artery.  The gastroduodenal artery
     arises from the common hepatic artery.  The celiac artery and its major
     branches are patent.  Active extravasation or potential source of bleeding
     from the celiac artery territory was not identified.  The imaging was carried
     out into the venous phase and the splenic vein, main and right and left main
     portal veins are patent.
     
     Gastroduodenal arteriography demonstrates patency of the right gastroepiploic
     artery and the superior pancreaticoduodenal arteries.
     
     Common hepatic arteriography post-embolization demonstrates ongoing patency of
     the downstream portion of the common hepatic artery and the left hepatic
     artery.  The proximal stump of the gastroduodenal artery is patent.  The coil
     embolization was performed from the origin of the gastroepiploic artery back
                                                                 (Over)

     to near the origin of the gastroduodenal artery.  On this arteriogram, a small
     branch arising from the proximal gastroduodenal artery was still perfused.
     Attempts to reenter the gastroduodenal artery stump to embolize this branch
     were unsuccessful.
     
     There were no immediate complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No arterial source of bleeding identified on celiac arteriography
     and superior mesenteric arteriography (with imaging focused on the superior
     half of the bowel).  Based on the history of a duodenal ulcer with blood clot
     at a prior upper endoscopy at an outside hospital and the findings of the
     diagnostic arteriograms, it was determined that the patient may benefit from
     and was a suitable candidate for gastroduodenal artery embolization.  This was
     performed with a residual small branch of the proximal gastroduodenal artery
     not occluded.  At the time of the final angiographic run, there was still some
     perfusion through the superior coils into another branch of the gastroduodenal
     artery as well.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      85 year old man with GI bleed and known duodenal ulcer on EGD last week at OSH. 
      EGD here on [**6-17**] was unsuccessful, unable to pass scope into stomach.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      pls evaluate GI bleed for embolization

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  85-year-old man with GI bleed and known duodenal ulcer on upper
     endoscopy at an outside institution.  The duodenal ulcer was unable to be
     treated by endoscopy by report.  Upper endoscopy was attempted here but was
     unsuccessful passing the scope beyond the cervical esophagus.
     
     PHYSICIANS:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 620**] [**Doctor Last Name 621**] and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1983**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2281**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2281**], the attending
     radiologist, present and supervising throughout the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Following written informed consent with the patient's daughter and
     son-in-law, the patient was positioned supine on the angiography table.
     Preprocedure timeout was performed to confirm patient, procedure and site.
     Standard sterile prep and drape of the right inguinal region.  Local
     anesthesia with 7 cc of 1% lidocaine subcutaneously.  Using a combination of
     palpatory and fluoroscopic guidance, a single wall puncture of the right
     common femoral artery was performed.  A 0.035-inch guidewire was advanced
     through the needle into the abdominal aorta using fluoroscopic guidance.
     Needle was exchanged for a 5-French vascular sheath, however, due to marked
     tortuosity of the iliac arteries this did not provide adequate stability for
     catheter manipulations in the aorta.  As such, the sheath was exchanged for a
     long 6-French vascular sheath.  A cobra catheter was used to select the
     superior mesenteric artery and superior mesenteric arteriography was
     performed.  Attempts were made to catheterize the celiac artery with cobra
     catheter, Sos Omni catheter, [**Doctor Last Name 2272**] catheter, but these were all
     unsuccessful.  Finally, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5790**] catheter was successful at selecting the
     celiac artery.  Celiac arteriography was performed.  Based on the patient's
                                                                 (Over)

Nursing Note (2000-0700)

Pt is a 84yr old male who returns to [**Hospital1 1979**] after having several BRBPR at rehab.  Pt was recently d/c'd [**6-16**] from [**Hospital1 1979**] for an UGIB found to be caused by a duodenal ulcer bleed; pt received 12U PRBC and 4 units FFP on last admission and was found to have a pna.  
At present pt has received a total of 3units PRBC and 4 units FFP without significant rise in his Hct.  He cont to have large melena stools. plan is prob to do an EGD today as workup.

Review of systems:
Neuro: At baseline, it appears pt is A&Ox2; lives at home with wife.  Per neighbor- [**Doctor First Name **] and [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 261**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5623**]--this couple have been functioning marginally at home.  Pt has had repeated hospitalizations and is requiring rehab placement once d/c'd from this admission.  Wife has had several cancer related surgeries/procedures as well as orthopaedic and is performing her ADL with increasing difficulty.  Both are reported by neighbors to have ETOH issues. On past admission, first contact was pt's neighbor--""stepson""--[**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5623**] who would then pass the info along to his wife who is HCP.  Pt agrees to this arrangement.  Presently pt requiring very frequent repetition of NPO status and reason for continued admission. He yells out quickly with position changes but denies pain. PERL; moving all extremities with some difficulty r/t deconditioning. 

CV: A-fib, lopressor on hold. HR 60-70's. BP stable 110-130/60-70's with occasional decrease to 90's while sleeping. Despite total of 3 units PRBC, no significant rise in Hct; 4th unit presently infusing for Hct 26.2. One large melena stool of approx 400cc at about 3am--pt became clammy, diaphoretic;;stating not feeling well. Symptoms resolved after about 5min. Rest of am labs pnd.  PIV's x3--become increasingly tender and prob requiring restarts d/t multiple blood  tx--? need for TLCL with poor access. Ankle edema 2+.

GI-  ABD soft, no tenderness.  C/o hunger.  Needs bedside and possible video swallowing study.  Pt. coughing when sipping or taking things by mouth.  EGD would not pass to esophagus ? d/t diverticulum in upper esoph.  Could be the cause of impaired swallowing.

     CHEST, PORTABLE
     
     INDICATION:  85-year-old man with upper GI bleed and resolving pneumonia, now
     with acute shortness of breath, evaluate for CHF or aspiration.
     
     CHEST, PORTABLE:  Comparison is made to prior study of [**3395-6-16**].  The heart size
     is in the upper limits of normal.  Again noted are patchy opacities throughout
     the left lung.  These are not significantly changed; however, there are now
     new opacities at the right base and small bilateral pleural effusions are
     present that are not changed.
     
     IMPRESSION:  New opacities at the right base.  This raises concern for
     aspiration.
     
     Findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5794**].

     INDICATION:  85-year-old man with resolving pneumonia and upper GI bleed
     status post coils now with question of aspiration.  Evaluate for aspiration.
     
     Oropharyngeal video swallow fluoroscopic evaluation:
     
     Mild oral and pharyngeal dysphagia with no evidence of aspiration.  A large
     diverticulum is noted in the pharynx.  Difficult to determine type of
     diverticulum (Zenker's versus Killian-[**Last Name (un) 5792**]).  Solid and liquids were
     observed to collect within diverticulum along with backflow swallow following
     throat clearing.  For further details, please refer to the video swallow
     evaluation from [**3395-6-19**].

     INDICATION:  Upper GI bleed and resolving pneumonia.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3395-6-19**].
     
     FINDINGS:  Less density to the right lower lung airspace disease is
     visualized.  I cannot compare the left airspace disease as this has been cut
     off from view.  There are no new airspace findings in the upper lungs.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Poor quality film - improving airspace disease at the right lower
     lung.
