Brief Hospital Course:
1. EtOH withdrawal: Pt was initiated on CIWA scale and was 
loaded with IV Valium, requiring 50mg IV in the ED.  He was 
requiring hourly checks for withdrawal and was sent to the 
[**Hospital Ward Name 1600**] ICU for closer monitoring.  His CIWA score subsequently 
decreased and was sent to the floor on [**2759-8-21**].   There were no 
episodes of seizure.  On day of discharge the patient was > 
72hours from his last drink and had an unremarkable CIWA score.  
He was discharged with four tablets of 5mg Valium for anxiety.

2. Hematemesis: NG lavage was performed in the ED which was 
negative.  Rectal guiaic for occult blood was negative.  A GI 
consult was obtained for further evaluation of his UGI tract 
given his history of HCV and past UGIB requiring transfusions.  
Serial HCT checks have been stable with no evidence of blood 
loss.  GI recommended further outpatient workup to be performed 
either at the [**Hospital1 9734**] or at [**Hospital1 19**].  The patient reports that he has 
a planned upper and lower endoscopy at the [**Hospital1 9734**] later this month 
and is already taking Protonix.

3. Anemia: Notable anemia on laboratory data, likely 
iron-deficiency.  He was started on FeSO4 and instructed to 
continue these tablets.
