History of Present Illness:
Pt is 73yo male who was recently diagnosed with lyme myelitis 
and was hospitalized. He was treated with Ceftriaxone and

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 10308**] arrived on a ventilator and was aggressively 
resuscitated using invasive monitoring. He was given intravenous 
boluses, transfused blood products and was placed on four 
pressors: Levophed, Neo-Synephrine, Dobutamine, and Pitressin. 
(Later, pt was also placed on epinephrine gtt as well.) Pt 
arrived with a Swan [**Last Name (un) 10309**] catheter, and cardiac parameters were 
hyperdynamic.

Given the pt's cardiac hx and mildly elevated cardiac enzyme, a 
STAT cardiology consult was obtained. STAT TTE showed preserved 
EF and no grossly abnormal wall motions. There was no 
pericardial effusion. All these findings essentially ruled out 
cardiogenic shock.

Pt arrived anuric to [**Hospital1 19**]. Pt was acidodic as well. Pt was 
started on sodium bicarbonate gtt. Nephrology consult was 
obtained. L femoral dialysis line was placed, and pt was 
initiated on CVVH.

LFT's began to rise, indicating likely shock liver.

Presuming septic shock, pt was given broad spectrum IV 
antibiotics. Given the severity of the shock, he was also 
started on activated Protein C gtt.

Despite all these measures, pt required increasingly higher 
doses of all the pressors to maintain bp. Serum lactic acid 
level peaked to > 10. Ventilation was difficult, requiring FiO2 
of 1.0 and high PEEP.

Family members were present and understood the critical state of 
pt's multi-organ failure. When pt's blood pressure could not be 
maintained, family members decided to make the pt DNR. Slowly, 
pt became bradycardic and hypotensive. Cardiac arrest ensued. Pt 
was pronounced deceased 4:45am, [**3298-4-12**]. Cause of death 
was cardiopulmonary arrest due to septic shock.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      73M with toxic megacolon s/p subtotal colectomy/ileostomy                       
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      eval line positions (PA, NGT, ETT)

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Line placement.  Status post colectomy.
     
     An endotracheal tube and Swan-Ganz catheter in satisfactory position.  A left
     PICC line terminates in the left brachiocephalic vein and a nasogastric tube
     terminates in the proximal stomach.  The side port of the NG tube may be just
     above the GE junction level.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are within
     normal limits.  There are bilateral alveolar opacities centrally in both
     lungs, slightly worse on the right than the left.  Bilateral pleural
     effusions, right greater than left are also noted.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Nasogastric tube side port likely just above the GE junction, and could be
     advanced for more optimal placement.
     
     2.  Central alveolar opacities, likely due to pulmonary edema from fluid
     overload.
     
     3.  Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
