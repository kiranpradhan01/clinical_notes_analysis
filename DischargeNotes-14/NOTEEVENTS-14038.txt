Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs
 
Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1053**] 
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath/fatigue

 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
pheresis catheter placement
thoracentesis
leukopheresis
 
History of Present Illness:
81 yo M with T-cell positive CLL (flow cytometry [**3016-7-1**] 
revealed expanded, abnormal T-cell population consistent with 
high grade T-cell lymphoproliferation) s/p leukophoresis x3 at 
[**Hospital6 **] (last [**12-4**]), h/o resected chest wall 
melenoma, and DM presents with WBC count of 678 requiring 
emergent leukophoresis and hypoxia (O2 sat 75% on RA).  He notes 
increased fatigue and shortness of breath this am.  He reports 
decreased appetite x2 weeks.  He denies fever, chills, cough, 
chest pain, belly pain, N/V/D, dysuria.  Of note he was started 
on Fludarabine this week; he received a dose on Mon, Tues, and 
Weds. 
.
Since [**6-16**] pt has had an increased WBC count and bilateral 
pleural effusions.  He was treated in July-August-October with 
Pentostatin which initially controlled his wbc count, however, 
recently his WBC count has increased to over 600K requiring 3 
sessions of leukophoresis to date.  He was started on 
fludarabine last week.  
.  
In the ED pt noted to be SOB with RA O2 sat of 75%, improved to 
95% on a NRB.  He was given combivent and Solumedrol.  CT Chest 
revealed large right-sided pleural effusion with near total 
collapse of RLL and partial collapse of RML, Smaller left-sided 
pleural effusion with associated compressive atelectasis.  (He 
was given mucomyst and bicarb prior to the contrast CT).  
.
Pt was evaluated by the BMT service.  Plt count noted to be 26K 
(baseline ~30K recently).  He received 2 bags of plts with an 
increase in his plt count to 55 and vit k x1.  He underwent a 
thoracentesis by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with 1.5 liters of serosanginous 
fluid removed.  He had a phoresis catheder placed in his right 
groin by general surgery.  Post-procedure CXR revealed 
improvement in right effusion w/o PTX.  His K was noted to be 
6.3 without ECG changes; he received kayexalate.  Upon arrival 
to the FICU he was started on leukophoresis by the transfusion 
service.    

 
Past Medical History:
- T cell leukemia with flow cytometry compatible with a pro 
lymphocytic leukemia; morphology and performance looks more like 
chronic lymphocytic leukemia 
- h/o left sided chest wall melanoma recently resected w/out 
apparent metastases (Nodal dissections not carried out; 
Metastatic work up negative to date)
- diabetes    
- h/o right knee arthritis

 
Social History:
Denies current tob or illicit drug use.  Quit tob 21 yrs ago; 
previously smoked 2ppd.  EtOH - One drink per week.  Married x58 
yrs; lives with his wife.

Pertinent Results:
REPORTS:
[**12-4**] Plural fluid cytology:
Monomorphic population of small lymphocytes, consistent with 
involvement by low grade lymphoma. 
.
[**12-6**] FLOW CYTOMETRY REPORT:
INTERPRETATION:
Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by:  A 
T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder, CD4 positive, with aberrant 
loss of pan-T marker CD3.
.
CT Chest [**3016-12-5**]: 
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism. 
2. Large right-sided pleural effusion with near total collapse 
of the RLL and partial collapse of the RML. Smaller left-sided 
pleural effusion with associated compressive atelectasis. 
3. Mediastinal and axillary lymph[**MD Number 285**] as described above. 
4. Apparent ascites. 
5. Tiny hypodense lesion in the liver is incompletely evaluated. 

6. Splenomegaly. 
.
CXR [**3016-12-7**]: Cardiomegaly, Bilateral pleural effusions (R>L) 
with hazy parenchymal opacity over the right mid lung zone. 
.
CT Abd [**3016-12-2**]:  Massive splenomegaly, increased in size 
compared to prior exam.  Development of small amount of ascites 
seen adjacent to the liver and spleen.  Left renal cyst present. 
 Numerous diverticula present in the sigmoid colon, unchanged.  
There is some fascia plane thickening present surrounding the 
sigmoid colon.  There is no evidence of bowel obstruction 
present.
. 
CXR (s/p first thoracentesis) [**3016-12-5**]:  No PTX, improvement in 
right pleural fluid
.
ECG:  NSR, rate 98, nl intervals, nl axis, no ST-T changes
.
[**12-11**] CXR:
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**12-9**] and 29.
Moderate-sized right pleural effusion is reaccumulating. Small 
left pleural effusion and left basal atelectasis are stable. 
Heart size is normal. No pneumothorax.
.
[**12-13**] CXR (s/p second thoracentesis):
IMPRESSION: Decrease in right pleural effusion following 
thoracentesis with no evidence of pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
81 yo M with T-cell positive CLL s/p leukophoresis x3 at NEBH,  
h/o melenoma, and DM who presented with WBC count of 678 
requiring emergent leukophoresis, and hypoxia secondary to 
pleural effusions.
.
#) Leukocytosis (600K) secondary to T-cell positive CLL:  Pt had 
a leukophoresis catheter placed in his right groin by surgery.  
He then underwent emergent leukophoresis, with good response, 
and was admitted to the ICU. He was leukophoresed a total of 3 
times during the admission.  He also underwent chemo with 
cytoxan and fludarabine, and tolerated this well.  His WBC count 
decreased to 216.6 on the day of discharge, and he did not have 
any signs of tumor lysis syndrome.  Pt's pleural fluid was 
negative for infection, fluid WBC count was elevated, and 
cytology was c/w low grade lymphoma.  Pt was continued on 
allopurinol, although at a lower dose given elevated creatinine 
on admission.  The day before discharge, the pt's leukophoresis 
catheter was removed by surgery, with adequate hemostasis.  Pt 
was instructed to follow up with his oncologist immediatley 
after discharge to discuss the possible administration of 
neupogen or nulasta.
.
#)  Hypoxia: Pt was satting in 70's upon arrival to the ED, 
likely secondary to large right sided pleural effusion and 
leukostasis.  Pt underwent a diagnostic/therapeutic 
thoracentesis in the ED (fluid non-infectious, but malignant), 
and then had reaccumulation of the R sided fluid seen on CXR 
over the next several days.  He then had a second therapeutic 
thoracentesis, and 1700 cc of serosanguinous fluid was removed 
from his R lung.  On the day of discharge, the pt was satting 
well on room air.  CXR the day before d/c did not show a 
pneumothorax s/p thoracentesis.
.
#)  Acute Renal Failure, Cr 1.7 on admission (baseline Creat 
0.9): Was likely secondary to leukostasis.  
- pt was given bicarb and mucomyst prior to chest CT
- pt was hyrdated gently and Cr decreased to 1.0 on day of 
discharge
. 
#) DM: Pt's metformin was held during the admisssion and on 
discharge. His blood sugars were controlled with sliding scale 
insulin.
.
#)  Anemia/Thrombocytopenia related to CLL and chemo:  Pt has 
received procrit with Pentostatin in the past.  He was supported 
during this admission with blood and platelet transfusions 
(total 4 U PRBC's, 5 U platelets), with goal platelets >50 
before procedures and goal hct>25.  Pt bumped appropriately s/p 
blood and platelet transfusions.
 
Medications on Admission:
-Metformin 500 mg p.o. daily
-Allopurinol 300 mg p.o. daily
-Cozaar 50 mg p.o. daily
-s/p Pentostatin 2-4 per meter squared q1-2 wks x2-3 mos with

     There is a moderately large right effusion extending into the minor fissure,
     new compared with [**3016-12-13**], with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.
     There is prominence of the right pulmonary hilum, similar to that seen on
     previous exams.  This could reflect either pulmonary lymphadenopathy or
     pulmonary hypertension.  There is atelectasis at the left lung base, but no
     left effusion.  No CHF.  Suspect underlying hyperinflation.
     
     IMPRESSION:  New moderate-sized right pleural effusion, with underlying
     collapse and/or consolidation.  Atelectasis at left base. Prominent right
     hium -- see comment.

      tiny (mm-sized) left subdural collection.  right hemisphere is slightly

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  81-year-old man with fall and head injury.  History of CLL.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT without priors for comparison.
     
     FINDINGS:  Multiple small nodules are seen in the brain, the largest measuring
     7 mm.  One is in the left cerebellar peduncle, one in the inferior left
     frontal lobe, one in the left temporoparietal region, one in the right
     temporoparietal region, and one in the right frontal lobe adjacent to the
     cingulate gyrus.  These nodules are all high in density, though not of the
     density to suggest bleed, however, the multiplicity suggests a metastatic
     process.  Additionally, there is a tiny, approximately millimeter sized extra-
     axial fluid collection along the right cerebral convexity, but without
     significant mass effect on the underlying cerebral cortex.  Multiple subtle
     low density lesions are seen scattered throughout the white matter of both
     cerebral hemispheres, and the right cerebral hemisphere appears slightly
     edematous compared to the left, with mild effacement of sulci, and narrowing
     of the lateral ventricle, though without midline shift. No intra- axial
     hemorrhage is identified.  No acute major vascular territorial infarct is
     seen.
     
     Bony structures are intact. polyp vs retention is noted in the right maxillary
     sinus. The reminader of the sinuses are clear. There is calcification of the
     vertebral and basilar arteries and of the choroid plexus.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  High density nodules and multiple ill-defined hypodensities scattered
     throughout the brain, suggestive of a metastatic process.
     
     2.  Very small (approximately 1 mm) right extra-axial fluid collection, with
     associated mild edema of the right hemisphere, but without midline shift.
     
     An MRI of the brain is recommended for further evaluation of these findings.
     
     Preliminary findings were relayed to the ED dashboard at 12:30 p.m., 25

     MRI OF THE BRAIN WITH GADOLINIUM
     
     Exam compared to the patient's CT scan of [**3017-1-6**].
     
     FINDINGS:  There is some abnormal signal material surrounding the brain, most
     notably adjacent to the right hemisphere, but also present in the left
     occipital and left frontal regions consistent with subdural hemorrhage.  There
     are multiple abnormal signal foci on the susceptibility sequence within the
     brain.  These are various in size and in location.  The pattern suggests
     amyloid angiopathy.  There is no definite evidence of territorial infarction.
     There are multiple T2 high signal intensity foci consistent with microvascular
     angiopathy.  There is one abnormal signal focus in the left parietal region,
     which corresponds to a somewhat permeative appearance on the patient's CT scan
     represent a possible infiltrative lesion such as malignancy.  There is a small
     lipoma over the left frontal region.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Small subdural hematomas as described.  Findings consistent with
     amyloid angiopathy.  Some of these appear to correspond to the areas of
     slightly increased intensity seen on the patient's CT scan.  Possible lytic
     lesion in the left parietal region.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL INFORMATION:  History of chronic lymphatic leukemia, status post fall
     with subdural hematoma on CT.
     
     MRI OF THE BRAIN WITH GADOLINIUM
     
     Exam compared to the patient's CT scan of [**3017-1-6**].
     
     FINDINGS:  There is some abnormal signal material surrounding the brain, most
     notably adjacent to the right hemisphere, but also present in the left
     occipital and left frontal regions consistent with subdural hemorrhage.  There
     are multiple abnormal signal foci on the susceptibility sequence within the
     brain.  These are various in size and in location.  The pattern suggests
     amyloid angiopathy.  There is no definite evidence of territorial infarction.
     There are multiple T2 high signal intensity foci consistent with microvascular
     angiopathy.  There is one abnormal signal focus in the left parietal region,
     which corresponds to a somewhat permeative appearance on the patient's CT scan
     represent a possible infiltrative lesion such as malignancy.  There is a small
     lipoma over the left frontal region.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Small subdural hematomas as described.  Findings consistent with
     amyloid angiopathy.  Some of these appear to correspond to the areas of
     slightly increased intensity seen on the patient's CT scan.  Possible lytic
     lesion in the left parietal region.

     INDICATION:  81-year-old male with CLL, with new-onset weakness and decreased
     breath sounds in the lung bases bilaterally.
     
     FINDINGS:  As seen on [**3017-1-7**], there is a large right-sided pleural
     effusion, and a small-to-moderate left pleural effusion.  The airspace within
     the right lung base and retrocardiac region cannot be evaluated due to
     underlying effusions, and therefore pneumonia is not excluded.  The upper
     lungs are better aerated.  The right IJ central venous catheter tip projects
     at the SVC/right atrial junction.  There is no pneumothorax.  The previously
     seen possible lucencies within the left clavicle and scapula are not included
     on this film.  Osseous structures are otherwise unchanged.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Stable large right and moderate left pleural effusions.

     HISTORY:  81-year-old man with abdominal pain.
     
     FINDINGS:  There are no prior studies available for comparison.
     
     There are several air-filled loops of mildly distended small bowel within the

     There is a nonspecific bowel gas pattern.  There is some mildly distended
     loops of air-filled small bowel within the abdomen.  However, gas is seen
     within the rectum and small portions of the colon.  This may represent an
     early small-bowel obstruction versus ileus.  Followup films is recommended.

     COMPARISON:  [**3017-1-6**].
     
     FINDINGS:  There is a new moderate sized mixed density subdural fluid
     collection on the right.  The lateral ventricle is completely compressed
     indicating mass effect from the subdural fluid collection as well as a 3 mm
     shift of the normally midline structures.  The mixed intensity of the

     hemorrhage.  Denser blood products are layering posteriorly.  The hematoma
     extends under the right temporal lobe, which is slightly elevated and medially
     displaced.  However, the basal cisternal spaces retain their normal
     configuration.  There is mild shift of midline structures to the left,
     unchanged since the previous day's examination.  Brain parenchymal attenuation
     is also stable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Stable right subdural hematoma.  Findings were reported by
     telephone to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at 9:20 a.m. on [**3017-1-17**].

     Central venous catheter remains in satisfactory position.  The cardiac
     silhouette is upper limits of normal in size and stable.  There are bilateral
     moderate-sized layering pleural effusions, right greater than left.  Overall,
     both effusions appear slightly larger in the interval.  There has been

     FINDINGS:  There has been some slight improvement in both the size of these
     right subdural hematoma and associated mass effect.  The configuration of the
     hemorrhage along the right cerebral convexity surface is unchanged.  There
     still remains mass effect, as shown by  compression of the right lateral
     ventricle and contralateral shift of the normally midline structures.  The
     basal cisternal spaces, however, have retained their normal configuration. The
     [**Doctor Last Name 63**]- white matter distinction is preserved.  No new intracranial hemorrhages
     are identified.  Mucosal thickening within the right maxillary sinus is stable
     and the other paranasal sinuses are clear.  Note of posterior scalp skin

     TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest was compared with examination
     from four days ago.
     
     FINDINGS:  Again seen is right-sided IJ central venous catheter, extending to
     the lower SVC.  There is significant worsening of the pleural effusions, and
     allowing for the increased effusion, probably no significant change in the
     pulmonary parenchymal pattern.  The cardiac silhouette is difficult to
     distinguish given the amount of effusion, but the visualized portions are
     probably unchanged.
