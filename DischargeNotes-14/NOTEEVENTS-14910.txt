Admission Date:  [**3033-8-3**]       Discharge Date:  [**3033-8-4**]

Date of Birth:   [**3033-8-3**]       Sex:  M

Service:  NEONATOLOGY

HISTORY:  Baby [**Name (NI) 106**] [**Known patient lastname 307**], twin #1 was born at 25-1/7 weeks
gestation at 15:00 on [**3033-8-3**] and died at 14 hours of age on
[**3033-8-4**] at 05:20 due to respiratory failure.

Baby [**Name (NI) 106**] [**Known patient lastname 307**] was born by spontaneous vaginal delivery to a
32-year-old gravida 4, para 0 now 2 woman.  The mother's
prenatal screens were blood type O positive, antibody
negative, rubella immune, RPR nonreactive, hepatitis surface
antigen negative, and group B Strep unknown.  This pregnancy
was complicated by in-[**Last Name (un) 22**] fertilization resulting in
monochorionic/diamniotic twins and a twin-to-twin transfusion
syndrome.

The week prior to delivery, laser ablation of the vessels was
attempted, but did not appear to be effective.  Several
amniocentesis reductions of polyhydramnios from this twin
were also done in the week prior to delivery.  Pregnancy was
also complicated with preterm labor with contractions despite
magnesium sulfate, rupture of membrane the morning prior to
delivery, and progressive labor.

The mother's medical history is remarkable for three
spontaneous losses, asthma, and a history of an abnormal
cervix, and cone biopsy.  
     
This infant emerged flexed with good color, spontaneous
activity.  He was given positive pressure ventilation and
intubated.  His Apgars were five at one minute and seven at
five minutes.  His birth weight was 650 grams, his birth
length was 31.5 cm, and his birth head circumference was 23
cm.

His admission physical exam revealed an extremely premature
infant with fused eyes and flat nipple buds.  Tone and
reflexes appropriate for gestational age.  Anterior fontanel
is soft and flat, bruising of the occiput, a 1 cm superficial
laceration in the occiput.  Eyes fused.  Palate intact.
Breath sounds coarse, but with equal aeration, subcostal
retractions.  Heart was regular, rate, and rhythm, no murmur.
Positive bowel sounds.  Abdomen is flat.  Three vessel
umbilical cord, bilateral testes undescended, patent anus.

The infant's NICU stay by systems:  Respiratory status:
Throughout his NICU stay, multiple ventilation and oxygen
strategies were employed using the conventional ventilation
and high frequency ventilation with increasing requirements
needed and ultimately requiring 100% oxygen for several hours
prior to his death.  He also received two doses of
surfactant.  He had respiratory and metabolic acidosis that
were corrected with ventilation strategies and sodium
bicarbonate.  His last arterial blood gas was pH 7.20, pCO2
of 49, pO2 of 31, bicarbonate of 20, and base deficit of -9.
The chest x-ray showed the endotracheal tube in good
position, and no acute changes to either lung fields.

Cardiovascular status:  The infant required increasing
pressor support after four boluses of normal saline.  He
required a maximum of 25 mcg/kg/min of dopamine and 25
mcg/kg/min of dobutamine.  At that point, hydrocortisone was
also given.  A grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur was heard
at the left mid sternal [**Last Name (LF) 3469**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] indomethacin was begun to
treat a presumed PDA.

Fluids, electrolytes, and nutrition status:  He was
maintained with an umbilical arterial and umbilical venous
line with dextrose initially requiring several boluses of
dextrose for hypoglycemia which was then resolved.  His
electrolytes at eight hours of age was sodium 143, potassium
3.4, chloride 108, bicarbonate 20.  His ionized calcium was
1.27.

Gastrointestinal status:  There are no issues.

Hematological status:  His hematocrit at the time of
admission was 45.7 with a followup of 49.5.  He did receive
10 cc/kg of packed red blood cells to assist with blood
pressure support.

Infectious disease status:  Infant was started on ampicillin
and gentamicin at the time of admission for sepsis risk
factors.  His initial white count was 5.0 with a differential
of 22 polys and 0 bands.  His platelets was 229,000.
Follow-up CBC showed a white count of 4.2 with a differential
of 20 polys and 0 bands, platelets of 184,000.  His blood
cultures did remain negative.

Neurological status:  [**Doctor Last Name 79**] showed rare spontaneous movement.
He was treated with Fentanyl for pain and sedation.

He experienced a progressive and then acute decompensation in
his cardiac and respiratory activity with immediate cardiac
arrest despite ongoing maximal support.  He was pronounced
dead at 05:20 by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].  His parents were notified and
updated throughout his NICU stay of his medical status and
increase in support needs.  The infant was baptized.  The
parents and extended family members came and spent time in
the unit after he expired.  The parents were given
photographs of the infant.

The family declined a postmortem examination.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Extreme prematurity at 25 weeks gestation.
2. Respiratory distress syndrome.
3. Respiratory failure.
4. Presumed sepsis.
5. Hypotension.
6. Presumed patent ductus arteriosus.
7. Status post hypoglycemia.

Neonatology Attending Note
Over the late evening/early morning [**Doctor Last Name **] required increasing respiratory and cardiac support.  

Resp: [**Doctor Last Name **] experienced multiple, prolonged desaturations requiring him to be taken off the ventilator and hand-bagged.  Various ventilator strategies were employed (CV and HFV) each leading to increasing mean airway pressure to support adequate saturations.  CXRs revealed the ETT to be in appropriate position, and no acute changes to the pulmonary lung fields. Blood gases were followed which initially showed a respiratory acidosis and then a metabolic process. Both situations were addressed, the latter with bicarbonate infusion.  Two doses of surfactant were given.  

Cardiac: Increasing cardiac support was required to maintain [**Doctor Last Name 800**] blood pressure. Several fluid volume boluses were given followed by increasing vasopressor support of dopamine and dobutamine.  A loud murmur was heard over the left sternal border and Indocin was begun for a presumed PDA.  After reaching maximal support with vasopressors, HCN was also begun.  

FEN: Maintenance IVFs were continued throughout with correction of hypoglycemia and metabolic acidosis.  

ID: Broad spectrum abx were being given for potential infection.  

Neuro: Fentanyl was given for pain/sedation.

Acutely [**Doctor Last Name **] experienced a decompensation in cardiac and respiratory activity with immediate cardiac arrest despite ongoing maximal support.  Time of death 05:20.

The parents were notified and updated throughout the evening of [**Doctor Last Name 800**] medical status and increasing support needs.  [**Doctor Last Name 800**] parents came to the unit soon after hearing of his passing to hold him.  [**Doctor Last Name **] was baptized earlier and the parents did not want us to notify others for them at this time.

Infant had a very difficult night with multiple ventilatory changes attempted.  Infant was initially on conventional--HIFI--back to conventional--numerous times with hand bagging at 100% throughout to keep sats 86-90.  This was a struggle the entire shift.  Infant received his second dose of Survanta; 4 NS boluses; and three doses of Na Bicarb.  Please see flow sheet for blood gas results.  Infant's BP was also very difficult to stabalize requiring increasing vasopressor support of dopamine and dobutamine.  A loud mumer was noted earlier in shift and Indocin was given for a presumed PDA.
