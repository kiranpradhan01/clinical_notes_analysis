Brief Hospital Course:
87 y/o male with advanced prostate CA s/p TURP, h/o bilateral 
hydronephrosis due to tumor at trigone s/p post stents (Right), 
OSA, afib on coumadin who presents with UTI and ARF on CRI, and 
elevated INR.  Given worsening renal failure secondary to 
underlying metatstaic malingnancy and poor prognosis, Pt's wife 
and family decided to concentrate on comfort and avoid 
aggressive measures.  After several sessions of hemodialysis, 
Family chose to further withdrawl care. Pt pronounced dead at 
15:36 on [**3426-6-23**]. Family present in the room. Autopsy deferred
.
#. Acute on chronic renal failure - Patient has a baseline Cr of 
1.6 with an elevation in BUN/Cr to 59/2.4. Pt with progressive 
renal failure [**3-9**] to underlying malignancy and associated 
obstruction.  Pt initiated on Hemodialysis which he tolerated 
well.  Discussed with urology who recomended revision of uretral 
stents which was not pursued as family wished to stress comfort. 

.  
# UTI: u/a compatible with urinary tract infection. Given prior 
history of VRE and gram negative bacteremia (pseudomona) in 
recent past, Pt was covered broadly. 
.  
#. Anion Gap Acidosis: Mixed lactic acidosis with acute renal 
failure.  BG elevated on presentation, but urine ketones 
negative.  Pt started on NaHCO3 and HD with little improvement 
in acidosis.  Worsening lactic acidosis [**3-9**] tumor necrosis

                                     FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
     INDICATION:  Prostate cancer, status post TURP, history of hydronephrosis,
     status post stent, with acute-on-chronic renal insufficiency.  Evaluate for
     hydronephrosis.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3426-3-1**].  Again seen is hydronephrosis and hydroureter
     on the right side, not significantly changed from prior study.  Also again
     seen is moderate hydronephrosis of the left kidney, not significantly changed
     from prior study.  The right kidney measures 9.4 cm.  The left kidney measures
     9.6 cm.  A stent is noted in the right ureter terminating within the bladder.
     There is evidence of heterogeneous material within the bladder.  There is
     also evidence of impinging mass, likely prostate.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Relatively unchanged bilateral hydronephrosis.  Stent seen within
     the right ureter terminating within the bladder.  Heterogeneous material
     within the bladder consistent with debris.  Likely prostate impinging on
     bladder.
     
     Discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 6585**] at 9:30am [**3426-6-15**], who reports patient has
     known prostate cancer invasion into bladder.

     INDICATIONS:  88-year-old man with advanced prostate cancer and bladder
     cancer.  Admitted for urinary tract infection.  Also status post bilateral
     ureteral stent placements.
     
     COMPARISONS:  Ultrasound from [**3425-6-14**].  No prior CT of the abdomen and
     pelvis.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial CT images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained without
     intravenous contrast, followed by CT imaging of the abdomen and pelvis with
     oral and intravenous contrast.  Sagittal and coronal reconstructions were also
     performed.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Limited comparison is also
     made to a chest CT from [**3426-3-14**].  There are residual small bilateral
     pleural effusions, but improved since the prior study.  There is residual
     ground-glass opacity and atelectasis and/or scarring at the bases.  The liver
     is diffusely heterogeneous, consistent with innumerable small hypoattenuating
     metastases.  This appearance is new in the visualized portions of the liver
     since [**3426-3-14**].  There is also a new small amount of ascites about the
     liver.  The patient is status post cholecystectomy.  There is extensive
     calcification of the splenic artery.  There is again a small 4-mm
     calcification in the spleen, probably a granuloma or perhaps a vascular
     calcification as well.  The pancreas appears normal.  There are similar
     bilateral adrenal masses, including a nodule-containing fat-like density of 19
     mm in diameter in the left adrenal.  This lesion is most likely an adrenal
     adenoma.  A nodule in the right adrenal of 28 x 36 mm in diameter is
     indeterminate.  The kidneys are relatively small, and the left kidney exhibits
     a 32-mm diameter simple cyst.  There are bilateral pigtail ureteral stents
     extending from the renal pelvises bilaterally into the bladder.  There is
     diffuse ureteral thickening particularly in the calices.  Although limited by
     poor opacification of the bowel, the stomach, small and large bowel appear
     unremarkable without obstruction.  There is extensive retroperitoneal
     lymphadenopathy consistent with metastatic tumor spread and this appearance is
     new since the prior chest CT.  There is diffuse edema in the subcutaneous
     tissues and mesentery consistent with anasarca.

     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is a Foley catheter and
     bilateral ureteral stents terminating in bladder which contains fluid and air.
     It shows diffuse irregular wall thickening up to 18 mm in thickness consistent
     with tumor spread.  There is infiltrate of soft tissue throughout the lower
     pelvis up to approximately 7.4 x 5.5 cm in axial dimensions, with an adjacent
     cystic area of 3.5 cm in diameter which could represent necrosis.  The soft
     tissue density abuts and probably involves the rectal wall and there is
     additional soft tissue extending about the right side of the rectum in the
     adjacent fat.  There is also a poorly defined large left iliac mass, a likely
     pelvic side wall lymph node or direct tumor extension.  There is no free
     fluid.  There is also marked left inguinal lymphadenopathy including a node as
     large as 23 x 22 mm.  There is a right inguinal hernia containing fat and
     fluid.
     
     Mild left-sided hydronephrosis is unchanged.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATIONS:  88-year-old man with advanced prostate cancer and bladder
     cancer.  Admitted for urinary tract infection.  Also status post bilateral
     ureteral stent placements.
     
     COMPARISONS:  Ultrasound from [**3425-6-14**].  No prior CT of the abdomen and
     pelvis.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial CT images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained without
     intravenous contrast, followed by CT imaging of the abdomen and pelvis with
     oral and intravenous contrast.  Sagittal and coronal reconstructions were also
     performed.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Limited comparison is also
     made to a chest CT from [**3426-3-14**].  There are residual small bilateral
     pleural effusions, but improved since the prior study.  There is residual
     ground-glass opacity and atelectasis and/or scarring at the bases.  The liver
     is diffusely heterogeneous, consistent with innumerable small hypoattenuating
     metastases.  This appearance is new in the visualized portions of the liver
     since [**3426-3-14**].  There is also a new small amount of ascites about the
     liver.  The patient is status post cholecystectomy.  There is extensive
     calcification of the splenic artery.  There is again a small 4-mm
     calcification in the spleen, probably a granuloma or perhaps a vascular
     calcification as well.  The pancreas appears normal.  There are similar
     bilateral adrenal masses, including a nodule-containing fat-like density of 19
     mm in diameter in the left adrenal.  This lesion is most likely an adrenal
     adenoma.  A nodule in the right adrenal of 28 x 36 mm in diameter is
     indeterminate.  The kidneys are relatively small, and the left kidney exhibits
     a 32-mm diameter simple cyst.  There are bilateral pigtail ureteral stents
     extending from the renal pelvises bilaterally into the bladder.  There is
     diffuse ureteral thickening particularly in the calices.  Although limited by
     poor opacification of the bowel, the stomach, small and large bowel appear
     unremarkable without obstruction.  There is extensive retroperitoneal
     lymphadenopathy consistent with metastatic tumor spread and this appearance is
     new since the prior chest CT.  There is diffuse edema in the subcutaneous
     tissues and mesentery consistent with anasarca.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     (Cont)
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is a Foley catheter and
     bilateral ureteral stents terminating in bladder which contains fluid and air.
     It shows diffuse irregular wall thickening up to 18 mm in thickness consistent
     with tumor spread.  There is infiltrate of soft tissue throughout the lower
     pelvis up to approximately 7.4 x 5.5 cm in axial dimensions, with an adjacent
     cystic area of 3.5 cm in diameter which could represent necrosis.  The soft
     tissue density abuts and probably involves the rectal wall and there is
     additional soft tissue extending about the right side of the rectum in the
     adjacent fat.  There is also a poorly defined large left iliac mass, a likely
     pelvic side wall lymph node or direct tumor extension.  There is no free
     fluid.  There is also marked left inguinal lymphadenopathy including a node as
     large as 23 x 22 mm.  There is a right inguinal hernia containing fat and
     fluid.
     
     Mild left-sided hydronephrosis is unchanged.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  New appearance of extensive metastatic disease, including numerous liver
     metastases, extensive retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
     2.  Large mass at the base of the bladder with diffuse bladder wall
     thickening, and likely involvement of the rectum posteriorly.
     3.  Small amount of new ascites.
     4.  Smaller pleural effusions.
     5.  Left inguinal lymphadenopathy.
     6.  Bilateral ureteral stents, with ureteral thickening, which may relate to
     tumor involvement as well.

     HISTORY:  Metastatic prostate cancer.  Acute mental status change.  Evaluate
     for bony metastases, mass or bleed.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT scan.
     
     COMPARISON STUDY:  [**3426-2-12**] head CT scan.
     
     FINDINGS:  A number of the images are degraded by patient motion.
     
     There is no sign of an intracranial hemorrhage.  There is no definite interval
     appearance of a major vascular territorial infarction.  Multiple chronic
     lacunar infarcts involving the basal ganglia are again seen.  No overt
     osteolytic or blastic lesion involves the skull.  However, there has been
     interval appearance (since the prior January study) of a relatively small area
     of scalp soft tissue swelling in the left frontal region superior to the
     lateral ventricles.  Has there been recent trauma to account for this finding?
     If not, a most unusual subcutaneous neoplastic or inflammatory process needs
     to be considered.
     
     CONCLUSION:  No intracranial hemorrhage.  New left frontal scalp abnormality -
     see above report.

     INDICATION:  88-year-old with locally advanced prostate and bladder cancer,
     status post TURP with hydronephrosis on prior study status post bilateral
     stents, evaluate for worsening hydronephrosis.
     
     RENAL ULTRASOUND:  Compared to renal ultrasound of [**3426-6-14**] and CT abdomen and
     pelvis of [**3426-6-15**].  There has been interval improvement and near resolution of
     the bilateral hydronephrosis seen on the prior ultrasound. Again noted is an
     approximately 3 cm simple cyst involving the mid to upper pole of the left
     kidney.  The left kidney measures approximately 10 cm and the right kidney
     measures approximately 10 cm.  No focal renal masses nor calculi are seen. The
     proximal portions of the stent are not well visualized; however, the distal
     portions of the bilateral internalized stents can be seen within the bladder.
     There is extensive soft tissue within the expected region of the bladder and
     prostate, presumably secondary to the extensive metastatic disease better
     delineated on the prior CT scan.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) Interval improvement of bilateral hydronephrosis.
     2) Extensive soft tissue within and surrounding the bladder, corresponding to
     the metastatic disease better delineated on the prior CT.
     3) S/p bilateral internalized ureteral stents, only the distal ends well
     visualized in this study.
     4) Left simple renal cyst.

     AP SEMI-UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY:  As on [**3426-3-13**], the	re is
     cardiomegaly.  A left-sided pleural opacity is demonstrated again, which may
     be partly related to chronic pleural thickening seen on older radiographs and
     possibly additional fluid.  There is lateralization of the right hemidiaphragm
     and haziness over the right lower hemithorax compatible with a right
     subpulmonic and partially layering effusion.  There is pulmonary
     redistribution, indistinctness of the central pulmonary vessels, compatible
     with congestion.
