PICC placement report:
PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: The patient was placed supine on the 
angiography table. A preprocedural timeout was performed to 
confirm the patient's identity and the type of procedure to be 
performed. Ultrasound was used to identify the right brachial 
vein which was patent and compressible. After injection of 5 cc 
of 1% lidocaine, a 21-gauge needle was advanced under ultrasound 
guidance into the right brachial vein. Hard copy ultrasound 
images were obtained before and after venous access documenting 
patency. A 0.018 guidewire was then advanced through the needle 
to the brachiocephalic vein where resistance was encountered. 
Therefore, Optiray contrast material was administered to 
visualize the area, revealing a near complete occlusion of the 
upper SVC. The micropuncture sheath was therefore replaced with 
a vascular access sheath and a Glidewire was able to be advanced 
into the lower SVC. Subsequently, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 10456**] PIC line was 
advanced with the tip in the lower SVC. The [**Last Name (un) 10456**] PIC line 
was cut to 45 cm length (41 cm intravascular portion) and the 
line was StatLocked and heplocked. The patient tolerated the 
procedure well and there were no immediate post-procedure 
complications.

IMPRESSION:
1. Near complete occlusion of the SVC.
2. Successful placement of a 4-French, 41 cm single lumen 
[**Last Name (un) 10456**] PICC via the right brachial vein with tip in the lower 
SVC. The line is ready for use.
.
ECHO [**2850-4-30**]:
Conclusions:  
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or  
color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5mmHg. 
There is  
moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left 
ventricular cavity  
size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. 
Overall left  
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Transmitral 
Doppler and  
tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV 
diastolic  
dysfunction. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right 
ventricular chamber  
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly 
dilated at the  
sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened 
but aortic  
stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are seen on 
the aortic  
valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly  
thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. 
Trivial mitral  
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern 
suggests impaired  
relaxation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. 
There is a  
probable vegetation on the tricuspid valve. The estimated 
pulmonary artery  
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 62 yo M h/o recent hospitalization for urosepsis, CVA, 
HTN, DVT p/w sepsis and was treated in the MICU with pressor and 
antibiotics. The possible source of his sepsis was thought to be 
his indwelling Hickman. The Hickman was removed and a PICC line 
was placed.
.  
1. Sepsis from Bacterial Line Infection (outside line): Pt was 
initially found to have a temperature of 104.9F during routine 
vital signs at his long term care facility ([**Location (un) 1133**] Manor). He 
was tranferred to [**Hospital1 **] and treated in the Micu for sepsis. 
However, pt has multiple potential sources for infection inlcude 
a possible infiltrate on CXR, positive U/A, infxn of sacral 
decub, and R Hickman. The patient was started on vanco and 
zosyn. He was on levophed for about 12 hrs for BP augmentation. 
Pt had blood cultures growing coag neg staph and enterococcus in 
blood cx. ID is following the patient and recommends treating 
pulling the Hickman catheter and placing a PICC line for access. 
This was done by IR. Sensitivities of the enteroccus species 
showed vancomycin sensitivity. Therefore, zosyn was stopped. 
After his initial positive blood cx on [**4-28**] remaining 
surveillance cultures were negative. The Hickman was removed and 
a PICC line was placed on [**5-3**] by IR (after receiving 3 bags of 
FFP). Noted by IR was a complete occlusion of the SVC by clot. 
He was discharged back to [**Location (un) 1133**] manor with 2 weeks of IV 
Vancomycin and directions for surveillance cultures after 
treatment. Also, if the pt. was febrile after treatment, ID 
recommended w/u of possible chronic osteomyelitis.
.  
3. SVC Deep Venous Thrombosis: as mentioned, this was 
incidentally noted by IR. He was asymptomatic and without UE 
swelling. The decision was made to continue his current 
anticoagulation with 7mg Warfarin daily.
.
2. decubitus ulcer: The patient has a chronic ulcers (stage III 
decubitis ulcers) that did not look infected.  Wound care was 
consulted and directed treatment of wounds. He also had blisters 
bilaterally on his lower extremities. Multipodus boots were 
placed to help prevent further ulcerations.  
.  
3. hypernatremia: The patient was hypernatremic upon admission. 
HE was hydrated with NS given his presumed dehydration. His 
total water deficit was 4150cc. He was administered free water 
flushes via his G-tube for gentle correction (250cc NGT Q4). His 
hypernatremia resolved. 
.  
4. h/o CVA: The patient was continued on valproic acid for sz 
ppx.  
.  
5. h/o dvt: We were unable to obtain further history of his 
DVTS. We continued coumadin at his home regimen.  
.  
6. benign Hypertension: Initially all antihypertensive meds were 
held. Low dose Norvasc 5mg was restarted on [**4-30**].  
.  
7. acute renal failure: The patient was admitted with Cr 1.8 
wich improved to 0.8 s/p volume resuscitation. Therefore, his 
ARF was attributed to a pre-renal etiology in the setting of 
fever/insensible losses. On discharge his ARF completely 
resolved.
.  
FEN: TFs per nutrition  
.  
ppx: coumadin, hold all heparin products (HIT+), iv ppi  
.

      62 year old man with s/p cva, with UE contractures, with contaminated hickman,

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      picc line placementplease remove hickman (from OSH) prior to placing PICC.      
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  62-year-old man status post CVA with contaminated Hickman and
     heparin induced thrombocytopenia.  Need for [**Last Name (un) 1828**] PICC line placement after
     removal of Hickman catheter.
     
     RADIOLOGIST:  Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 4805**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 250**] performed the procedure.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 250**],
     the attending radiologist was present and supervising throughout the
     procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  The patient was placed supine on the angiography
     table.  A preprocedural timeout was performed to confirm the patient's
     identity and the type of procedure to be performed.  Ultrasound was used to
     identify the right brachial vein which was patent and compressible.  After
     injection of 5 cc of 1% lidocaine, a 21-gauge needle was advanced under
     ultrasound guidance into the right brachial vein.  Hard copy ultrasound images
     were obtained before and after venous access documenting patency.  A 0.018
     guidewire was then advanced through the needle to the brachiocephalic vein
     where resistance was encountered.  Therefore, Optiray contrast material was
     administered to visualize the area, revealing a marked narrowing of the upper
     SVC.  The micropuncture sheath was therefore replaced with a vascular access
     sheath and a Glidewire was able to be advanced into the lower SVC.
     Subsequently, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1828**] PIC line was advanced with the tip in the lower SVC.
     The [**Last Name (un) 1828**] PIC line was cut to 45 cm length (41 cm intravascular portion)
     and the line was StatLocked and heplocked.  The patient tolerated the
     procedure well and there were no immediate post-procedure complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Near complete occlusion of the SVC.
     2.  Successful placement of a 4-French, 41 cm single lumen [**Last Name (un) 1828**] PICC via
     the right brachial vein with tip in the lower SVC.  The line is ready for use.
     The presence of the SVC narrowing was communicated to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 5851**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8499**]
     at approximately 7:30 p.m. on [**2850-5-3**].
