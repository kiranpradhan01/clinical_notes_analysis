Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1397**] 
Chief Complaint:
respiratory distress, hemoptysis
transferred from OSH

 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
debridement of mass from tracheal lumen by interventional 
pulmonary
 
History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo male with PMH large right thyroid cystic mass eroding into 
trachea, who presented to [**Hospital6 **] [**3339-3-22**] with 
hemoptysis and respiratory distress, now diagnosed with 
anaplastic thyroid carcinoma.  
.  
Pt reports that he noticed a right neck mass last October. The 
mass grew larger, to the size of a baseball. It appears that FNA 
was performed but was non-diagnostic (probably because 
anaplastic tumors tend to be necrotic). The mass appears to be 
cystic in nature and has been aspirated at least 3 times, which 
decrease in size each time. Now size is 6.5cm*6.5cm. Plan for 
surgery in Oct was deferred [**3-5**] syncope and pacer placement for 
SSS; again deferred 2 weeks ago [**3-5**] URI; was planned for surgery 
this Thurday.  
.  
Pt was o/w in his USOH until 2-3 weeks ago when he developed a 
URI with symptoms of dry cough; no fever, chills, sore throat, 
myalgias. Pt was treated with 3 days of an antibiotics, followed 
by a 10 day course of levaquin (completed 2 days PTA). Per pt 
and son, no documeted pna. 2 days prior to admission, pt 
developed hemoptysis; states he coughed up 4 tsp of blood. 1 day 
PTA, pt developed stridorous breathing and respiratory distress. 
Pt was initially seen at [**Hospital1 **], where he was given steroids, 
with improvement in respiratory status. Pt was transferred to 
[**Hospital6 1232**], where his surgeon is located. There he 
was admitted to the MICU. Thyroid cyst was aspirated with 
removal of 300cc of fluid. Pt was given racemic epinephrine and 
Decadron 10mg IV x1. CT neck showed tracheal mass per nursing 
s/o (pt brought CT).
.  
Pt now breathing more comfortably. He has not had fever and 
night sweats but reports weakness and weight loss for several 
months recently.

Physical Exam:
VS: T 99.4, BP 119/59, HR 76, RR 18, 99%RA  
Gen: NAD  
HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, clear OP, MMM  
Neck: Large ~6 x 6 cm sized right thyroid mass, soft, possibly 
cystic, non-tender. L lobe of the thyroid gland also prominent.  

CVS: RRR, nl s1 s2, no m/g/r  
Lungs: transmitted upper airway stridor; otherwise clear  
Abd: soft, NT, ND, +BS  
Ext: no edema  
Neuro: CN [**3-15**] intact, [**6-5**] bilateral upper and lower extremity 
strength.  

 
Pertinent Results:
CT Neck-IMPRESSION:
1. 7-cm diameter right neck mass, with direct invasion of the 
subglottic, cervical and proximal thoracic trachea. The mass is 
reportedly thyroid in origin. Differential diagnosis includes 
primary head/neck cancer and lymphoma.
2. Left lobe thyroid enlargement with heterogeneous appearance.
3. Right upper paratracheal and prevascular lymphadenopathy as 
well as additional nodes in the right side of the neck. 
Dedicated MR of the neck may be helpful for more complete 
assessment of the neck mass and lymphadenopathy if warranted 
clinically.
.
Pathology: The tumor is composed of a relatively monotonous 
proliferation of spindle cells which grow in sheets with a 
prominent vascular pattern.  Immunostains for cytokeratin AE1/3 
and CAM 5.2, CD-68, CD-79a, CD-138, S-100, LCA absorbed CEA, 
EMA, CD34, CD31, TTF-1, actin, desmin, MNF-116, calcitonin, and 
thyroglobulin are negative.  These results exclude both melanoma 
and hematopoietic neoplasms.  The differential diagnosis 
includes, but is not limited to, sarcoma, spindle cell 
carcinomas (sarcomatoid carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive 
tract and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma), and malignant salivary 
gland neoplasms.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was transferred here for further mgmt of airway and large 
thyroid mass by our IP team. IP found endotracheal obstructing 
tumor and extrinsic  
compression of the high trachea by thyroid mass. After rigid 
bronchoscopy with removal of the intratracheal tumor component 
on [**3339-3-24**], stat pathology showed anaplastic tumor. He was 
tranferred to the MICU. Subsequently extubated and his 
respiratory Sx are now improved. Pt was seen by Rad Onc, who 
recommended transfer to the East Campus for XRT.  On the morning 
of possible radiation, patient and family met with 
interventional pulmonary team who explained that the most recent 
CT showed further invasion of the tumor into the trachea.  After 
a long discussion, patient and family asked to be made CMO.  
Patient was started on morphine drip and palliative care team 
was consulted with recommendations to ensure comfort. Mr. 
[**Known patient lastname 10513**] died approximately 24 hours after decision to be CMO, 
on [**3339-3-31**].

     INDICATION:  Large thyroid mass and stridor.
     
     No prior studies are available for comparison.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is asymmetric soft tissue prominence projecting over the
     right neck with leftward deviation of the trachea.  The airway otherwise
     appears unremarkable on this single frontal view.
     
     There is a dual-lead left- sided cardiac pacemaker noted.  The heart and
     mediastinal contours are otherwise unremarkable.  There is minor vascular
     crowding or atelectasis at the left lung base medially.  Otherwise, no focal
     areas of consolidation or effusion.  Gas distended loops of bowel are noted in
     the visualized upper abdomen.  The osseous structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Findings consistent with known large thyroid mass with leftward
     deviation and narrowing of the trachea.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Endotracheal tumor.  Large right thyroid mass.  Stridor.
     
     There is an approximately 7 cm diameter large necrotic mass in the right side
     of the neck, extending from the submandibular region to the thoracic inlet
     level.  The mass extends into the thorax and invades the trachea.  Tracheal
     invasion is present in the subglottic airway as well as the cervical and
     proximal thoracic trachea.  At the level of the thoracic inlet, the tumor
     within the airway narrows the airway lumen to approximately 11 mm in diameter
     from an expected diameter of 22 mm at this level based on the tracheal
     cartilage measurements.  The mass also partially erodes the right thyroid
     cartilage.  Emanating from the left lobe of the thyroid gland is a
     heterogeneous thyroid mass extending inferiorly along the left paratracheal
     region and slightly deviating the trachea towards the right below the thoracic
     inlet level, ending just above the level of the aortic arch.  Below this
     level, the trachea and main bronchi are normal.
     
     The lungs were incompletely imaged per the CT trachea protocol but demonstrate
     atelectatic changes in the left lower lobe superior segment adjacent to the
     descending thoracic aorta.
     
     Note is also made of retained secretions within the trachea and proximal main
     bronchus on the left.
     
     Dynamic expiratory CT images are suboptimal as the patient did not appear to
     be able to cooperate with dynamic expiratory breathing instructions.
     
     Assessment of the neck is limited due to absence of intravenous contrast as
     the patient was unable to receive intravenous contrast due to elevated
     creatinine level of 4.7.  There are apparent lymph nodes within the right side
     of the neck adjacent to the dominant tumor mass.  Within the mediastinum,
     there is also a superior mediastinal node anteriorly in the retrosternal
     region and in the upper rigth paratracheal region.
     
     The imaged skeletal structures demonstrate no suspicious lytic or blastic
     skeletal lesions.
     
     Calcified granulomas and small calcified lymph nodes are incidentally noted.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     MULTIPLANAR AND 3D RECONSTRUCTIONS: These images confirm the presence of
     tracheal compression and invasion from the adjacent right neck mass, as well
     as compression below this level from the adjacent enlargement of the left
     thyroid gland. 
     
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1. 7-cm diameter right neck mass, with direct invasion of the subglottic,

     origin. Differential diagnosis includes primary head/neck cancer and
     lymphoma.
     
     2. Left lobe thyroid enlargement with heterogeneous appearance.
     
     3.  Right upper paratracheal and prevascular lymphadenopathy as well as
     additional nodes in the right side of the neck.  Dedicated MR of the neck may
     be helpful for more complete assessment of the neck mass and lymphadenopathy
     if warranted clinically.
