Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2683**] 
Chief Complaint:
stroke
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none
 
History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness:  Ms. [**Known patient lastname 11180**] is a 66 year old
right-handed woman who has a history of two prior strokes with
residual weakness (husband not sure which side) and trouble with
speech, multiple MI's, and thyroid disease, who was found lying
on the floor by her husband 30 minutes ago.  She was last seen
normal at 3:30 p.m. when her husband observed her sitting up in
bed watching TV.  Then at about 5 p.m. he heard a thump and 
found
that she had fallen out of bed and was lying on her left side. 
He thinks that she was trying to talk but says she wasn't
producing any sounds, and wasn't following any commands.  EMS
arrived and found her to be nonverbal with left sided weakness. 
She was then brought to the [**Hospital1 19**] ED.  I was able to examine her
(as described below) immediately upon arrival, after which she
was intubated due to her somnolence.

Per her husband Ms. [**Known patient lastname 11180**] had strokes in 9/04 and [**1-29**], both 
of
which were treated at the [**Hospital1 168**].  He is not sure where the
strokes were located, but thinks they were from clots and not
bleeding.  She has residual weakness on one side (first he said
left, then right) and has trouble speaking, but can walk with a
cane at baseline.  He notes that her function has been declining
lately but cannot say why.  She does not take any medications 
per
her own choice.  She has no history of diabetes or hypertension. 


Review of systems:  No known recent systemic illness per her
husband.  

 
Past Medical History:
Past Medical History:
- Strokes in 9/04 and [**1-29**] as above
- Per husband had [**3-27**] MI's total
- High cholesterol
- Thyroid problem

 
Social History:
Social History: Lives with her husband.  Uses marijuana.  No
tobacco/EtOH/other drug use.

 
Family History:
Family History: N/C

 
Physical Exam:
Examination:
T  afebrile    HR 93   BP 161/86   RR 18  Pulse Ox 100% on O2 NC
General appearance: Frail 66 year old woman lying in bed with
eyes closed, occasionally squirming with right arm and leg
HEENT:  c-spine collar in place due to fall
CV: Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs or gallops. No
carotid bruits.
Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen: Soft, nontender, nondistended, no hsm or masses 
palpated
Extremities: no clubbing, cyanosis or edema

Mental Status:  Eyes are closed, does not open them to voice or
noxious stimuli.  Does not follow commands.  Does not produce 
any
sounds or attempt to speak.  She does squirm with her right arm
and leg with sternal rub.

Cranial Nerves: Right pupil round and reactive 3>2, left round
and reactive 2.5>2.  Right gaze preference, can get to midline
but not past (could not check with OCR due to C-spine collar). 
Does not blink to threat on either side.  There is no nystagmus.
She has R>L facial weakness.  She would not open her mouth.

Motor System: Diffusely diminished muscle bulk.  Tone is normal
on the right, flaccid on the left.  She spontaneously moves the
right arm and leg, semi-purposefully, but has no movement of the
left arm and leg, even to noxious stimuli.

Reflexes: Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ and symmetric.  Plantar
responses are extensor on the right, equivocal on the left.  No
[**Doctor Last Name 4294**].

Sensory: She neglects the left side completely, with her head
turned to the right. Localizes to noxious stimuli with right
arm/leg, does not seem to notice noxious stimuli on the left
(although the latter assessment was made difficult by the fact
that she was getting needle sticks on both the right and left
side simultaneously during my examination)

Coordination/Gait:  Could not assess

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient admitted to ICU under Neurology Service because 
intubated.
Neurology:Patient had MRI done on day of admission which showed 
right MCA inferior division acute stroke. Concern for seizure 
was less likely and Dialntin and EEG cancelled. Patient had a 
full stroke work up which revealed triglycerides of >900, 
cholesterol > 300 and TSH >100. She was started on gemfibrazole, 
Synthroid, and Atorvastatin. She had a TTE which was negative 
for LV dysfunction, thrombus, or vegestations. In terms of her 
exam, she followed no commands, had no speech, was very agitated 
despite propofol/fentanyl, did not blink to threat, had left 
hemiparesis arm > leg. She was able to be weaned to CPAP but 
extubation was not possible because of copius secretions and 
lower lung collapse. She developed a ventilator associated 
pneumonia and was started on Vancomycin and Zosyn. She was fed 
via NG tube. Her daughter and proxy made the decison to make the 
patient CMO as it was likely patient would need PEG and 
tracheostomy in long term management. Palliative Care was 
consulted and patient made CMO. She died on [**2636-3-3**].

     INDICATION:  Left hemiplegia and right gaze deviation.  History of previous
     cerebral infarctions involving the left middle cerebral and right posterior
     cerebral arterial territories.
     
     COMPARISON:  No previous studies at [**Hospital1 1937**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast head CT was obtained.  CT angiogram of the circle of
     [**Location (un) **] and the neck vessels was performed using 100 cc of intravenous Optiray,
     and multiplanar two-dimensional and three-dimensional reformatted images were
     obtained.  A CT perfusion study with evaluation of cerebral blood flow and
     cerebral blood volume was performed and analyzed.
     
     NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT:  There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage.  The acute
     infarction demonstrated in the right temporal lobe on the subsequent
     diffusion-weighted MR images on [**2636-2-27**] is occult on the current
     study. There is a large subacute-appearing infarction in the left middle
     cerebral artery territory, which was shown to be older than 10 days on the
     subsequent MRI. There are small bilateral chronic posterior cerebral artery
     territory infarctions.  The ventricles are normal in size.  There are no
     abnormal extra-axial collections.
     
     The petrous apices are pneumatized bilaterally.  There is anterior fusion in
     the cervical spine at C5 through C7. The patient is intubated.  The imaged
     paranasal sinuses are normally aerated.

     (Cont)
     CT ANGIOGRAM OF THE CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) 4**] AND NECK VESSELS:  Bilateral common
     carotid, internal carotid and vertebral arteries are patent without evidence
     of significant stenoses.  The petrous segments of the internal carotid
     arteries are markedly tortuous, particularly on the right.  The V3 segments of
     the vertebral arteries are also tortuous.
     
     The right middle cerebral artery is smaller in caliber than the left.  The M1
     segment is patent.  A horizontal branch of the M2 segment is thrombosed
     (series 4, image 245). However, it appears patent on the MRA dated [**2636-2-27**],
     possibly due to thrombus resolution. Other tributaries of the circle of [**Location (un) **]
     are patent without evidence of occlusion, stenosis, or aneurysm.
     
     CT PERFUSION:  There is a large area of decreased blood flow (increased mean
     transit time) and decreased blood volume in the right temporal lobe,
     consistent with irreversible infarction.  There are moderate area of decreased
     blood flow (increased mean transit time) and relatively preserved blood volume
     posterior and anterior to the irreversible infarction, and a large area of
     decreased blood flow (increased mean transit time) and relatively preserved
     blood volume inferior to the irreversible infarction, consistent with ischemic
     penumbrae.
     
     The following preliminary report was provided by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1345**] on [**2636-2-26**]
     in CCC:  Large area of hypodensity in left middle cerebral artery territory,
     consistent with subacute infarct.  No evidence of acute hemorrhage.
     Hypodensity in right cerebellum suggesting prior infarct.  No definite feeling
     defects identified on CTA.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  CT perfusion study demonstrates a large irreversible infarction in the
     right temporal lobe, which is occult on routine CT images.  There is a large
     ischemic penumbra inferior to the irreversible infarction and moderate
     ischemic penumbrae anterior and posterior to the irreversible infarction.
     
     2.  Thrombosis of a horizontal branch of the M2 segment of the right middle
     cerebral artery. Please note that the thrombosis is no longer evident on the
     [**2636-2-27**] circle of [**Location (un) **] MRA.
     
     3.  Late subacute infarction in the left middle cerebral artery territory.
     Chronic infarctions in the right and left posterior cerebral artery
     territories.

     INDICATION:  Left hemiplegia and right gaze deviation.  History of previous
     cerebral infarctions involving the left middle cerebral and right posterior
     cerebral arterial territories.
     
     COMPARISON:  No previous studies at [**Hospital1 1937**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast head CT was obtained.  CT angiogram of the circle of
     [**Location (un) **] and the neck vessels was performed using 100 cc of intravenous Optiray,
     and multiplanar two-dimensional and three-dimensional reformatted images were
     obtained.  A CT perfusion study with evaluation of cerebral blood flow and
     cerebral blood volume was performed and analyzed.
     
     NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT:  There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage.  The acute
     infarction demonstrated in the right temporal lobe on the subsequent
     diffusion-weighted MR images on [**2636-2-27**] is occult on the current
     study. There is a large subacute-appearing infarction in the left middle
     cerebral artery territory, which was shown to be older than 10 days on the
     subsequent MRI. There are small bilateral chronic posterior cerebral artery
     territory infarctions.  The ventricles are normal in size.  There are no
     abnormal extra-axial collections.
     
     The petrous apices are pneumatized bilaterally.  There is anterior fusion in
     the cervical spine at C5 through C7. The patient is intubated.  The imaged
     paranasal sinuses are normally aerated.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     (Cont)
     CT ANGIOGRAM OF THE CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) 4**] AND NECK VESSELS:  Bilateral common
     carotid, internal carotid and vertebral arteries are patent without evidence
     of significant stenoses.  The petrous segments of the internal carotid
     arteries are markedly tortuous, particularly on the right.  The V3 segments of
     the vertebral arteries are also tortuous.
     
     The right middle cerebral artery is smaller in caliber than the left.  The M1
     segment is patent.  A horizontal branch of the M2 segment is thrombosed
     (series 4, image 245). However, it appears patent on the MRA dated [**2636-2-27**],
     possibly due to thrombus resolution. Other tributaries of the circle of [**Location (un) **]
     are patent without evidence of occlusion, stenosis, or aneurysm.
     
     CT PERFUSION:  There is a large area of decreased blood flow (increased mean
     transit time) and decreased blood volume in the right temporal lobe,
     consistent with irreversible infarction.  There are moderate area of decreased
     blood flow (increased mean transit time) and relatively preserved blood volume
     posterior and anterior to the irreversible infarction, and a large area of
     decreased blood flow (increased mean transit time) and relatively preserved
     blood volume inferior to the irreversible infarction, consistent with ischemic
     penumbrae.
     
     The following preliminary report was provided by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1345**] on [**2636-2-26**]
     in CCC:  Large area of hypodensity in left middle cerebral artery territory,
     consistent with subacute infarct.  No evidence of acute hemorrhage.
     Hypodensity in right cerebellum suggesting prior infarct.  No definite feeling
     defects identified on CTA.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  CT perfusion study demonstrates a large irreversible infarction in the
     right temporal lobe, which is occult on routine CT images.  There is a large
     ischemic penumbra inferior to the irreversible infarction and moderate
     ischemic penumbrae anterior and posterior to the irreversible infarction.
     
     2.  Thrombosis of a horizontal branch of the M2 segment of the right middle
     cerebral artery. Please note that the thrombosis is no longer evident on the
     [**2636-2-27**] circle of [**Location (un) **] MRA.
     
     3.  Late subacute infarction in the left middle cerebral artery territory.
     Chronic infarctions in the right and left posterior cerebral artery
     territories.

     seen in the anterior cervical spine at the C5 through 7 levels, with screws
     within C5 and C7.  Marked degenerative changes are seen throughout the
     cervical spine with osteophyte formation and disc space narrowing at multiple
     levels.  There is mild 1 anterolisthesis of C2 on C3.  There is mild grade 1
     retrolisthesis of C4 on C5.  CT does not provide intrathecal detail comparable
     to MR, however the thecal sac appears grossly intact.  Scarring is noted at
     the visualized lung apices.  Contrast material noted intracranially,
     consistent with recent CTA.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  No evidence of acute fracture.  Mild anterolisthesis of C2 on C3 and
     retrolisthesis of C4 on C5, possibly degenerative although ligamentous injury
     cannot be excluded on this study.
     2.  Severe degenerative changes seen throughout the spine.
     3.  Anterior cervical fusion hardware noted.

     IMPRESSION:  Normal MRA of the neck.
     
     MRA OF THE HEAD:
     
     The head MRA is slightly limited by artifacts.  There is diminished flow
     signal seen and diminished number of branches visualized in the right sylvian
     region which could be secondary to diminished flow from the infarct or due to
     occlusion.  However, the middle cerebral artery trunk is well visualized.  The
     remaining arteries of anterior and posterior circulation demonstrate normal
     flow signal.
     
     IMPRESSION diminished sylvian branches of right MCA as described above,
     otherwise unremarkable MRA of the head.

     Admitting Diagnosis: STROKE;TELEMETRY
     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
         66 year old woman with ETT with new elevation in WBC and increased  
      secretions w/ new desats
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      pneumonia?  chf?

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  66-year-old female intubated with elevated white cell count and
     increasing secretions.
     
     Comparison is made to prior radiographs dated [**2-27**] and [**2636-2-29**].
     
     SINGLE AP PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH
     
     When compared to prior film, there is increased patchy opacity involving much
     of the right lower lobe and a more well defined consolidative opacity
     retrocardiacally likely within the left lower lobe which likely represents an
     area of segmental left lower lobe collapse.  There is increased plate-like
     atelectasis noted within the left base. Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar
     contours are grossly unchanged and there is no evidence of pulmonary edema or
     pleural effusions.  Endotracheal tube is approximately 3 cm from the carina
     and nasogastric tube is identified within the stomach with its distal tip not
     visualized.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Increased patchy opacification of right lower lobe worrisome for pneumonia
     in this ventilated patient.
     
     2.  Increased better defined retrocardiac opacity likely representing a
     segmental left lower lobe collapse with underlying consolidation also in the
     differential.
     
     Findings discussed with caring physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 527**]. [**Last Name (STitle) 621**] on date of exam at
     approximately 1:10 p.m.

Neuro: Lightly sedated on propofol. Moves RUE and RLE purposefully on this level of sedation. Moves LLE on the bed non-purposefully. LUE is flacid. Pupils 4mm, equal, round, reactive to light. Slight disconjugate gaze. Does not regard examiner or interact or follow commands. Localizes to ETT and oral care. Gag, cough reflexes impaired, corneal reflexes intact. No change in neuro exam off propofol however pt does appear very uncomfortable and becomes relatively hypertensive and tachycardic and tachypnic with sedative off.

Pain: Treated with 25 mcg fentanyl x2 at 5AM and 515AM for pain as evidenced by tachycardia (120's+), tachypnea (30's) with good result - RR decreased to approx 20, HR 100-110, and SPO2 rose from low 90's to high 90's.

Resp: Lungs are coarse in the upper fields, diminished bibasilar. Suctioned for large amounts of neon yellow sputum, cx sent. Plan to send an ABG shortly.

CV: Sinus tachy rhythm with rate 100's-110's, occ ventricular ectopy. Vital signs as noted in flowsheets. Palpable distal pulses. Pneumoboots on, sc heparin continues. PIVx2.

GI: Abd soft and non-distended. Bowel sounds present. Tolerating tube feeds at goal 45cc/hr as per order via OGT. Removed mushroom catheter as it has had no output recently.

GU: Foley to gravity drains cloudy foul-smelling yellow urine in adequate amounts.

Endo: RISS with coverage as ordered.

Lytes: Repleted potassium with 40meq PO.

Skin: Intact.

Social: No family contact

Plan:
-Maintain safety
-Pain / sedation management
-Q2 hr neuro checks
-Pulmonary toileting, ween vent as tolerated
-Notify team of acute changes
