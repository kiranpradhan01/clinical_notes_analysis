Admission Date:  [**2521-9-19**]     Discharge Date:  [**2521-9-23**]

Date of Birth:   [**2441-7-29**]     Sex:  F

Service:  Medicine, [**Location (un) **] Firm
CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Gastrointestinal bleed.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 80-year-old woman
with cryptogenic cirrhosis, known portal hypertension, history of
hepatic coma, and coronary artery disease who presented to
[**Hospital 2882**] Hospital on [**2521-9-19**] with a 2-day to 3-
day history of melena.

She was found to be guaiac-positive by examination, but since she
was hemodynamically stable at the time, she was discharged home
from the Emergency Department.  She had a light dinner that
evening, and shortly afterwards became diaphoretic, nauseous, and
had one episode of hematemesis.
She was brought back to the Emergency Department at [**Hospital1 **]
[**Hospital 922**] Hospital approximately three hours after she was initially
discharged.  At this time, she was found to be hypotensive,
diaphoretic, and with a hematocrit drop to 26.  An nasogastric
lavage was performed in the Emergency Department and did not
clear with 2 liters of normal saline. An emergent
esophagogastroduodenoscopy was done which showed very large 10-cm
varices crossing the gastroesophageal junction.  Sclerotherapy
was used but unable to stop the bleeding.  She was intubated and
then sent to [**Hospital1 10**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Vital signs on
admission revealed temperature was 98.1, blood pressure
was 118/56, heart rate was 64, oxygen saturation was 100%
(intubated), respiratory rate was 10 to 14.  Physical
examination in general revealed the patient was intubated and
sedated.  Her pupils were equal, round, and reactive.  Her
neck was supple with no lymphadenopathy appreciated.  Her
sclerae were anicteric.  Her mucous membranes were moist.
Her chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Her heart
had a regular rate.  Normal first heart sound and second
heart sound.  A [**1-22**] soft early peaking systolic murmur at the
left upper sternal border.  No third heart sound or fourth
heart sound were appreciated.  Her abdomen was markedly
distended with normal active bowel sounds.  It was soft and
nontender.  No fluid wave was appreciated.  Three well-healed
surgical scars were noted.  The liver and spleen could not be
palpated secondary to ascites.  She had no cyanosis,
clubbing, or edema.  Her lower extremities were in Pneumo
boots with 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses
bilaterally.  On skin examination, she had no rashes, palmar
erythema, or prominent spider hemangiomas.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratory
values on admission revealed white blood cell count was 4,
hemoglobin was 10, hematocrit was 29.1, platelets were 81.
PT was 15.3, PTT was 27.2, INR was 1.6.  Chemistry panel
revealed sodium was 139, potassium was 4.4, chloride was 112,
bicarbonate was 17, blood urea nitrogen was 12, creatinine
was 0.5, and blood glucose was 183.  Calcium was 6.1,
magnesium was 1.4, phosphorous was 3.4.  ALT was 12, AST
was 18, LDH was 188, alkaline phosphatase was 52, total
bilirubin was 0.7.

PERTINENT STUDIES DURING HOSPITALIZATION:
1.  Cardiac enzymes were cycled times three with a peak
creatine kinase of 385, CK/MB was 11, and troponin was less
than 0.3.
2.  A chest x-ray on [**2521-9-20**] showed an opacity in the
left lower lobe with minimal left pleural effusion.
3.  A right upper quadrant ultrasound on [**2521-9-20**]
showed a heterogenous liver consistent with cirrhosis, no
intrahepatic or extrahepatic ductal dilatation.  Positive
splenomegaly.  Positive small amount of ascites noted in
perihepatic, perisplenic, and pelvic areas.
4.  Esophagogastroduodenoscopy done on [**2521-9-20**]
revealed grade III varices starting in the lower one-third of
the esophagus with a stigmata of recent bleed and oozing from
multiple areas. Six and six injections sclerotherapy were
performed with appropriate hemostasis.  Clotted blood was
seen throughout the whole stomach.  A large adherent clot was
present in the fundus which prevented complete visualization.

IMPRESSION:  This is an 80-year-old with cryptogenic
cirrhosis and portal hypertension presenting with a
gastrointestinal bleed secondary to a esophageal varices.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  Upon admission, the patient was
directly transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit where
an nasogastric lavage was performed which did not clear after
5 liters of normal saline.

An emergent esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed which
showed grade III varices which were successfully sclerosed.
No other sites of bleeding were noted.  The patient was then
started on Octreotide on which she was continued for 72 hours
without complications.

A right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed which showed
a small amount of ascites; however, the patient was started
on ciprofloxacin for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis
prophylaxis in the setting of a variceal bleed.

The patient's cause for cirrhosis has been evaluated extensively;
and per records from [**Hospital 2882**] Hospital, she is hepatitis
negative and rapid plasma reagin nonreactive. She has a history
of hepatic coma one year prior to this admission, at which time
her cirrhosis was initially diagnosed. Fortunately, alpha-
fetoprotein has been negative over the past year.

In addition to Octreotide, the patient was restarted on her
outpatient dose of nadolol 40 mg p.o. q.d.

The patient's primary gastroenterologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] at
[**Hospital 2882**] Hospital was contacted through Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10358**]
who performed the esophagogastroduodenoscopy at [**Hospital1 392**].

2.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient with a baseline hematocrit of
around 34.  On presentation, hematocrit was 26 at the outside
hospital and 29 on admission to [**Hospital1 391**].  She received a total of 2 units of packed red blood
cells with an appropriate hematocrit bump in the Intensive
Care Unit.  After transfusion and sclerotherapy, the
patient's hematocrit remained stable for greater than 48
hours prior to discharge.

On admission, the patient's INR was elevated to 2.5 secondary
to liver disease.  She was given three doses of vitamin K
with INR normalizing at 1.3.

She was also noted to have thrombocytopenia which was thought
secondary to her splenomegaly.

3.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient with a history of hypertension
and coronary artery disease.  Given anemia, she was at high risk
for demand ischemia; and therefore she was ruled out for
myocardial infarction by cardiac enzymes.  On admission, she was
hypotensive; and therefore blood pressure medications were held
on hospital day one.  As her blood pressure normalized, her ACE
inhibitor and beta blocker were titrated up with no
complications.  She was to restart her long-acting nitrate upon
discharge.

4.  PULMONARY:  On admission, the patient was intubated and
sent directly to the  Medical Intensive Care Unit.  After an
emergent esophagogastroduodenoscopy, she was weaned off the
ventilator and extubated the following morning without any
difficulties.  Her oxygen saturation remained high for the
remainder of her hospital course.

5.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was afebrile with a normal
to slightly elevated white blood cell count throughout her
hospitalization.  Given her portal hypertension and small amount
of ascites, there was some concern for spontaneous bacterial
peritonitis, and she was started on ciprofloxacin for
prophylaxis.  She was discharged with instructions to complete a
7-day course of ciprofloxacin.

6.  ENDOCRINE:  On presentation, the patient with a questionable
history of diabetes mellitus; however, she was not on any
outpatient medications for this diagnosis.  Her fingerstick
glucose throughout this admission was consistently less than 200
and most in the 100 to 150 range. She was monitored on q.i.d.
fingersticks and covered on a regular insulin sliding-scale.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable
and improved.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Upper gastrointestinal bleed.
2.  Grade III esophageal varices; status post sclerotherapy.
3.  Portal hypertension.
4.  Cryptogenic cirrhosis.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Nadolol 40 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Asacol 800 mg p.o. t.i.d.
3.  Isordil 30 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Captopril 25 mg p.o. t.i.d.
5.  Lactulose 20 g p.o. q.i.d.
6.  Ciprofloxacin 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. (times five days; to
complete a 7-day course).

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  The patient was to follow up with her primary care
physician (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3318**]) in approximately two to four
weeks.
2.  The patient was to follow up with her primary
gastroenterologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**]) at [**Hospital 2882**] Hospital
