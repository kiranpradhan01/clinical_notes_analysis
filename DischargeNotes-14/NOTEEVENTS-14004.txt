Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 76**] 
Chief Complaint:
Difficulty speaking
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
CTA
 
History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 89 yo woman with PMH sig for CAD s/p MI and HTN as well 
as partial colonic resection for polyp who presents as a Code 
Stroke after being found aphasic by her family.  She was last 
seen well ~2 pm (6 hours before arrival) and was without 
complaint [**Last Name **] problem at the time.  She was then found by her
family sitting at home unable to speak.  

On arrival, her FS was 168.  She was awake, nearly mute and 
followed occasional simple commands.  She initially had mild 
weakness of the right side, but this worsened between exams in 
the ED.  Emergent head CT showed some loss of the left insular 
ribbon.  She was outside of the 6 hour iaTpa window. 
 
Past Medical History:
CAD s/p MI
s/p partial colectomy for polyp(adenoma w/high grade dysplasia)
HTN
Hyperlipidemia
Osteoarthritis
Diverticulitis
 
Social History:
Pt lives in area. Her family is closely involved.
 
Family History:
nc
 
Physical Exam:
Vitals:144/64, 63, 27, 97% on 2L
Gen:NAD. 
HEENT:MMM. Sclera clear. OP clear
Neck: No Carotid bruits
CV: RRR, Nl S1 and S2, no murmurs/gallops/rubs
Lung: Clear to auscultation bilaterally
Ext:No cyanosis/edema
.
Neurologic examination:
Mental status: Awake and alert, aphasic, so semi-cooperative 
with exam
Orientation: Unable
Pt could not repeat. No meaningful verbal output, she mumbled 
garbled speech.  She could follow 1 step commands, but not two 
step well.  
Unable to further assessment MS as a result
.
Cranial Nerves:
I: not tested
II: Pupils equally round and reactive to light, 4 to 3 mm 
bilaterally. BTT on right, but possible left homonymous 
hemianopsia(difficult to tell based on exam)
III, IV, VI: Extraocular movements intact bilaterally without 
nystagmus.
V, VII: Facial strength and sensation intact and symmetric, 
except mild right NLF flattening.
VIII: Hearing intact to finger rub bilaterally.
IX, X: + gag
[**Doctor First Name 219**]: Trapezius normal bilaterally.
XII: Tongue midline without fasciculations
.
Motor:
Normal bulk and tone bilaterally.  No tremor. Pt initially had 
no drift and apparent full strength on the left (somewhat 
limited by cooperation).  On the right, she was initially able 
to hold up UE and LE for 10 seconds with some drift.  On re-eval 
after CT, she had worsened, with inability to hold LE up and 
significant drift of her UE.  Formal testing not possible given 
her poor cooperation.
.
Sensation: Pt would not acknowledge LT throughout but did 
grimace to nox stim in all exts.  Some w/d on right, but minimal 
on left.
.
Reflexes: B T Br [**MD Number 454**]
Right     1 1 t  1   0
Left      1 1 t  1   0
.
Toes were mute on left, up on right.
.
Coordination: Would not cooperate with any testing
.
Gait: Not tested

.
PT: 10.6  PTT: 22.9  INR: 0.9  
Fibrinogen: 368
. 
CXR normal
.
MRI: 
1. Extremely limited study due to claustrophobia and motion.
2. No mass effect/hydrocephalus/midline shift.
3. Diffusion-weighted images not available to assess for acute 
stroke.
.
CTA brain/neck : Large infarction in the distribution of the 
left middle cerebral artery. No filling defects seen in the CTA 
images of the circle of [**Location (un) 449**]. 
.
CT perfusion:     A large area of increased mean transit time 
and decreased cerebral blood flow is present in the left frontal 
and parietal lobes consistent with infarction in the 
distribution of the superior and inferior divisions of the left 
middle cerebral artery. 
.
CTA Chest:
1.  Study is somewhat limited due to respiratory motion.  
Allowing for this,
no evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2.  Multiple 2- to 3-mm nodules within the lung parenchyma.  
Followup
dedicated CT scan within 1 year's time is recommended.
3.  Right adrenal myelolipoma.
4.  Low-density segment 2 left liver lobe lesion incompletely 
characterized.
Correlation with ultrasound or MRI is recommended if clinically 
indicated.
5.  Dense atherosclerosis.
.
EEG:
ABNORMALITY #1: Low voltage delta frequency slowing was seen 
persistently in the left central and posterior temporal region.
ABNORMALITY #2: A slow and disorganized background reaching a 
maximum frequency of 7 Hz was seen throughout the recording.
ABNORMALITY #3: Generalized delta frequency slowing with an 
occasional bifrontal predominance was seen.
BACKGROUND: See abnormality #2.
HYPERVENTILATION: Contraindicated due to acute stroke.
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Produced no activation of the 
record.
[**Doctor Last Name **]: No normal transitions from wakefulness to [**Doctor Last Name 292**] were 
seen.
CARDIAC MONITOR: A regular rhythm with an average heart rate of 
78 bpm was noted.
IMPRESSION: This was an abnormal routine EEG due to the presence 
of focal slowing in the left centrotemporal region, indicative 
of dysfunction of the subcortical structures in that region. The 
slow and disorganized background with bursts of generalized 
slowing suggest a mild to moderate encephalopathy.
.
TTE:
Conclusions: 
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No right-to-left passage of 
microbubbles is 
identified at rest. The estimated right atrial pressure is 
0-5mmHg. Left 
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function 
are normal 
(LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. 
Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) 
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild 
(1+) aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. 
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). 
The pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is an 
anterior space 
which most likely represents a fat pad. 
 .
IMPRESSION: Mild aortic regurgitation with mild aortic valve 
sclerosis. No 
discrete vegetation or definite cardiac source of embolism 
identified. 
.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Neuro:  Pt. was found to have a large L MCA infarct on CT 
perfusion (see results above).  She continued to have global 
aphasia and R hemiparesis throughout admission. TTE was 
performed and showed no evidence of cardiac source of thrombus.  
Lipid panel was checked and Lescol was increased as lipids were 
above goal.  She was evaluated by speech and swallow, who felt 
that she would need a PEG for long term nutrition.  This was 
discussed with her family, who felt that she would not want such 
an invasive procedure and said that they would want her care to 
focus on comfort. 
.
Pulmonary:  Pt. was noted to have stridor on exam and was 
tachypneic on the floor to the 40s.  She was transferred to the 
ICU for close monitoring.  CTA Chest was performed and showed no 
evidence of PE.  She was seen by Pulmonary, who felt that she 
most likely had laryngeal edema causing her symptoms.  She was 
evaluated by ENT who confirmed supraglottic edema, and she was 
treated with racemic epinephrine and a Decadron pulse with 
improvement in her respiratory status.
.
CV:  Pt. was noted to go into a HR of 140s-160s intermittently 
on the floor.  She was controlled with Metoprolol.

Goals of Care:  Per the patient's previously stated wishes, her 
family decided to pursue comfort care only.  She has been 
comfortable with occasional doses of sublingual morphine for 
respiratory effort/agitation. She will be discharged to 
Lighthouse for continued hospice care.
