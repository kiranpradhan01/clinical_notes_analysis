Attending:[**Doctor First Name 3818**] 
Chief Complaint:
transfer from outside hospital for biventricular pacemaker 
placement and further medical management
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
biventricular pacemaker placement, [**2815-8-14**]
 
History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] y/o male with complicated cardiopulmonary PMHx notable for 
CAD s/p MI [**2-19**], CABG x 4 complicated by wound staph infection 
leading to sternectomy. Dialated cardiomyopathy with EF 10-20%. 
Also with DM, CRI, esophageal mass obstruction, s/p bx with 
indeterminate path; s/p stenting with relief of obstruction. 
Also with COPD, O2sats high 80s on RA baseline. Presented at OSH 
on [**2815-8-5**] with COPD exacerbation, ? asp PNA and dehydration 
with increased Cre. Stay was c/b over diuresis and pressor 
dependent hypotension felt to be [**1-19**] diuresis and ACEI therapy. 
Pt also c. diff positive and Rx flagyl day 7 of 10 on [**8-14**]. ECG 
revealed wide LBBB. Pt's son Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Known patient lastname 11349**] arranged for transfer 
to [**Hospital1 19**] for consideration for biventricular PM to help pt from 
recurrent CHF hospitalizations. Lenghty discussion with son and 
pt with EP fellow and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1259**] re: risk/benefit of 
[**Hospital1 **]-ventricular pacer placement in elderly pt with co-morbidity. 
Pt son understood the risk including possibility of obtaining 
little clinical benefit; but still wished to proceed. Pt 
remianed full code. 
 
Past Medical History:
CAD s/p CABG
COPD
Congestive heart failure

Abdomen: nontender, nondistended
Extremities: trace pulses throughout, no edema
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Pt transferred from outside hospital and brought directly to EP 
laboratory where he underwent biventricular pacemaker placement 
without complication.  Pt tolerated procedure well and then 
brought to CCU for close monitoring.  Pt did well in CCU without 
symptoms, mentating well, answering questions appropriately.  Pt 
then transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 455**] 3 but remained on CCU team.  About 5 AM 
[**2815-8-16**], pt found to have SBP in 50s and CCU team called 
emergently.  Pt found to be hypoxic with O2 sats in 70s, not 
mentating appropriately, and emergently intubated.  Pt brought 
back to CCU and started on dopamine for BP support.  Pt's 
hypotension continued despite increasing dopamine and adding 
levophed & dobutamine, with MAPs in the 30s.  Pt's son was 
called & came to bedside.  Per family wishes, no further 
aggressive measures were undertaken.  Pt went into ventricular 
fibrillation at 1:30 PM [**2815-8-16**] and passed away within minutes.  
Pt's son declined post-mortem.

     PORTABLE AP CHEST:  The patient has a dual chamber pacemaker in situ, with
     apparent good placement of the leads, although a lateral has not been
     obtained. There appears to be a separate biventricular pacing wire in-situ.
     An esophageal stent is in situ. No pneumothorax is present. The heart is
     normal in size. The medial aspect of the left lower lobe is not clearly
     defined. There may be some collapse/consolidation  at this site.
     
     Granulomatous changes  are noted in right mid lung zone. The lungs are
     otherwise clear. Degenerative changes are noted in the spine.

     INDICATION:  Status-post pacemaker insertion.
     
     COMPARISON:  Compared to previous examination from [**2815-8-14**].
     
     CHEST, PA and lateral views:  The patient has a intracardiac device in-situ
     with right atrial and right ventricular leads, and a 3rd biventricular pacer
     lead in-situ.  These all appear to be in satisfactory positioning.  There is
     evidence of some blunting of the left costophrenic diaphragm, which seems to
     have progressed from yesterday, and likely represents a small left-sided
     effusion.  In addition, on the lateral view, there is progressive
     opacification posteriorly from superior-to-inferior consistent with a layering
     effusion, posteriorly and inferiorly.  The lungs otherwise appear grossly
     normal.  As before, there is an esophageal stent in-situ.  No stent or wire
     fracture is seen.

     INDICATION:  Patient has new left subclavian line.  To evaluate for line
     placement.
     
     The patient has been intubated, and the ET tube now lies 4.2 cm from the tip
     of the carina.  An esophageal stent is in situ.  NG tube appears in good
     position at the distal end of the esophageal stent.  New left-sided subclavian
     line is identified in good position.  A right-sided internal jugular line is
     identified in good position.  Patient has a dual chamber pacemaker in situ
     with a third biventricular pacing wire.  Allowing for a degree of rotation
     these appear in good position.
     
     There is evidence of bibasal emphysema.  A small left-sided pleural effusion
     is seen.  Allowing for differences in technique, the lungs appear grossly
     clear and not significantly changed from radiograph taken previous day.

CCU NSG NOTE: PT DEATH
Pt deteriorated on [**Hospital Ward Name **] 3 overnight, was started on dopamine and intubated and transfered to CCU ~7:30am. He received a-line and triple lumen, had dopamine increased from 5 to 12 mic/kilo, received a 2nd 500cc NS bolus and had levofed up to 2 mic/kilo and dobutamine at 5 mic/kilo added with continued poor blood pressure. Blood gases showed increasing acidosis and lactate up to 11. His son as the health care proxy, advised continuing pressures without adding further treatment. At ~1315 he went from from paced rhythm with capture to minmimal capture and by 1320 he was in fine VF. Pt was asystolic by 1325. Pt pronounce dead and son was with him at the time. Son appreciative of care, being supported by wife. Arrangements will be made.
