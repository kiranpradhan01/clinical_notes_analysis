Service:  #58

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 11359**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old
woman with a past medical history of hypertension, coronary
artery disease, status post myocardial infarction with
pacemaker, who presented with 35 minutes of generalized tonic
clonic activities suppressed by 15 mg of Valium.  The patient
had reported been at her baseline in her usual state of
health, interactive, fluent until the day of admission when
she was last seen at 2:00 p.m.  She had been resting in her
room and was found in convulsions at approximately 3:40 p.m.,
unresponsive with a systolic blood pressure of approximately
180 to 200.  Emergency medical services arrived within twenty
minutes and she was given 5 mg of IM Valium followed by 10 mg
of intravenous before resolution of her symptoms.  She was
reported at this time to hve copious secretions.

In the Emergency Room she was loaded with 1 gram of Dilantin
and intubated for airway protection.  A left femoral central
line was initially placed and then removed secondary to a
hematoma, a right was later placed.

Per nursing home staff and family she had not been ill prior
to this.  She had no history of prior seizures.

Upon admission to the Intensive Care Unit she was intubated
and not responsive.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Hypertension.  2.  Tremor.  3.
Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction.
4.  Left humerus fracture.  5.  Hypercholesterolemia.  6.
Status post cataract surgery.  7.  Status post pancreatic
surgery.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  1.  Effexor 37.5 mg po q day.  2.
Lipitor 10 mg po q day.  3.  Monopril 20 mg po q day.  4.
Multivitamins.  5.  Plavix 75 mg po q day.  6. Prevacid 15 mg
po q day.  7.  Pericolace one tab po b.i.d.  8.  Celebrex 100
mg po q day.  9.  Senokot two tabs q.h.s.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs significant
for a temperature of 98.8.  Blood pressure 150/75.  Heart
rate 95, intubated, sating 100% on 40% FIO2.  Oral mucosa
moist.  No lymphadenopathy.  Lungs with diffuse crackles.  No
wheezing.  Cardiac examination with a 2 out of 6 systolic
ejection murmur heard best at the apex.  Regular rate and
rhythm.  No rubs.  No gallops.  Abdomen soft, nontender,
nondistended with positive bowel sounds.  She was moving all
four extremities.  She had a large left groin hematoma not
firm or indurated.  She had no active bleeding at the site.
Her right dorsalis pedis pulse was not palpable.  Posterior
tibial was not dopplerable on the left.  Her dorsalis pedis
pulse was dopplerable, but her posterior tibial pulse was not
palpable or dopplerable.  Her skin was without rashes.
Neurologically she was intubated and sedated.  She withdrew
mildly to all extremities on examination.  She had positive
dolls eyes.  No corneal reflex was noted upon initial
examination.  She had a surgical pupil, both were reactive.
Her tone was slightly increased.  She had mild intermittent
tremor of the chin and right upper extremity when she tried
to bring it midline.  Reflexes were 1+ and symmetric at
biceps, triceps, brachial radialis bilateral in upper
extremities 1+ at patellar and Achilles.  Her toes were up
going bilaterally.

Ventilator settings upon admission were pressor support of 10
and 5, 40% FIO2, respiratory rates in the 20s with tidal
volumes in the 300s.  Arterial blood gas at this point was
7.37/46/187.

ADMISSION FILMS:  CT of the head showing low attenuation with
white matter at the junction of the right MCA and PCA
territories.  Lack of associated mass factor atrophy
suggesting a possible subacute watershed infarct.  Without
prior films for comparison.  Acuity was noted to be difficult
to ascertain.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count of 8.0,
hematocrit 33.2, platelets 162, sodium 142, potassium 3.6,
chloride 104, bicarb 24, BUN 29, creatinine 1.1, glucose 151.
Urinalysis with no nitrites and no ketones.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit for monitoring.  Left groin line placed
in the Emergency Department was discontinued secondary to
hematoma.  She was transfused with 2 units of packed red
blood cells for a hematocrit drop in this setting.  Post
transfusion hematocrit showed an appropriate bump.  A groin
line was placed for access.

Dilantin level was therapeutic after an initial load in the
Emergency Department.  Potassium, magnesium and calcium were
all repleted.  She remained hemodynamically stable throughout
her Intensive Care Unit stay.  She remained intubated during
her short stay in the Intensive Care Unit and extubation was
deferred secondary to transfer to the outside hospital.  At
the time of discharge the patient remained intubated,
withdraws to painful stimulus in all extremities.  Toes are
up going bilaterally and dolls eyes were intact.

She is to be transferred to [**Hospital3 2255**] Neurological step
down unit as all of her records are at [**Hospital3 2255**].

     INDICATION:  Status post intubation.
     
     COMPARISONS:  None.
     
     SUPINE AP CHEST:  The patient is rotated.  Endotracheal tube is 1.5 cm above
     the carina.  There is a left-sided ICD with atrial and ventricular leads.
     The heart is enlarged. There is bilateral increase in interstitial markings.
     There are no pleural effusions.  Upper abdomen shows multiple slightly
     prominent loops of gas filled small bowel, measuring up to 3.3 cm in
     diameter.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) ETT 1.5 cm above the carina.
     2) Bilateral interstitial prominence could represent chronic fibrosis or acute
     interstitial edema.  Clinical correlation is necessary as there are no prior
     studies for comparison.
     3) Mildly distended gas filled loops of small bowel in the upper abdomen.
     Supine and upright KUB may be helpful for further evaluation.

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: New onset seizure.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast axial images were obtained from the skull base to the
     vertex.
     
     CT HEAD: Diffusely prominent sulci ventricles and basal cisterns consistent
     with age appropriate involutional change. There is no mass effect, shift of
     the normally midline structures, intraaxial or extraaxial hemorrhage, or
     hydrocephalus.
     
     There is low attenuation in the periventricular white matter in the
     periventricular region  consistent with chronic microvascular disease. There
     is low attenuation in the white matter at the junction of the right MCA and
     PCA territories. This may be due to a watershed infarct of undetermined
     age. There is no adjacent mass effect disproportionate atrophy. There are
     marked calcifications within the vertebral and basilar arteries. The osseous
     structures are unremarkable. There is minimal mucosal thickening in the
     ethmoid sinuses.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of acute hemorrhage. 2. ? right parietal
     watershed infarct of undetermined age ( in absence of prior studies)
     Consider MR [**First Name (Titles) 957**] [**Last Name (Titles) 8348**] images if further evaluation is clinically
     indicated. 3. Severe changes of small vessel disease.

     HISTORY: Mildly distended small bowel loops on chest x ray of [**2754-7-10**].
     
     SUPINE PORTABLE ABDOMEN, 1 VIEW: Since the prior chest radiograph of 1 day
     earlier, there has been interval placement of an NG tube, which is coiled
     within the stomach, with bend likely in the antrum and possibly in the
     proximal duodenum and tip in the distal stomach. The bowel gas pattern is
     nonspecific. No dilated loops of small or large bowel are appreciated. There
     is no evidence of free intraperitoneal air. The heart is enlarged. The lung
     bases are clear.
     
     IMPRESSION: Interval NG tube placement as above. No evidence of obstruction or
     free intraperitoneal air.

     HISTORY: ETT repositioning.
     
     PORTABLE AP CHEST: Comparison [**2754-7-10**]. There is an ETT 3.6 cm above the carina.
     There is an NG tube coiled within the stomach. The patient is rotated. The
     heart is enlarged. There is a dual lead pacer with lead tips in the region of
     the RA and RV. Technique and slight respiratory artifact make it difficult to
     evaluate for the lungs, however, the lung parenchyma does not appear
     significantly changed.
     
     IMPRESSION: Interval placement of NG tube. Repositioning of ETT which is 3.6
     cm above the carina.
