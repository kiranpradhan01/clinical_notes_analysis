CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Transfer from [**Hospital3 3090**] status
post VF arrest.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 44 year-old
female with a past medical history of type 1 diabetes status
post renal and pancreatic explant and peripheral vascular
disease who presents to [**Hospital3 3090**] at 2:00 a.m. on
[**9-30**] with abdominal pain.  Hours later she was found to be
agitated and suddenly arrested.  The patient was shocked at
200 J and was found to be in complete heart block and was
given epinephrine times two, rhythm consistent with V tach
and was shocked at 300 jewels, transitioned into sinus
tachycardia.  She was loaded on Amiodarone, which
precipitated hypotension and was started on Dopamine and
Levophed.  The patient was intubated.  Arterial blood gas on
intubation 7.11/20/79.  The patient was ventilated at AC
500/12, FIO2 1.00.  Electrocardiogram at that time showed [**Street Address 4568**] elevations in the anterior lateral leads.  The patient
was stabilized and transferred to [**Hospital1 1205**] for catheterization.  Echocardiogram prior to
transfer showed an EF of 25 to 30% with akinesis of the
anteroseptal and lateral walls.  At catheterization the
patient had a 70% occlusion of the proximal left anterior
descending coronary artery with cardiac output 3.13, cardiac
index of 2.12, PCW 33, PA pressures 58/30.  IABI was placed.
The patient was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for
continued care.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Type 1 diabetes.
3.  Status post renal cadaveric and pancreatic explant in
10/93.
4.  Peripheral vascular disease status post fem [**Doctor Last Name **] bypass
with a bilateral below the knee amputation.
5.  Fourth digit amputation of her left hand secondary to
osteo with coag negative staph and [**Female First Name (un) 929**].
6.  Status post myocardial infarction in [**3279**].
7.  Status post total abdominal hysterectomy.
8.  Sarcoidosis.
9.  Severe depression.
10.  Hypothyroidism.

ALLERGIES:  Cipro, Reglan, Erythromycin, Calcitonin.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
1.  Heparin.
2.  Dopamine.
3.  Levophed.
4.  ASA.
5.  Hydrocort 100 q 8.
6.  Prevacid.
7.  CellCept.
8.  CSA.
9.  Florinef.
10.  Amiodarone.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General, critical ill patient on
ventilator.  HEENT E tube in correct position with mouth
block. Drainage from nasogastric tube.  Cardiovascular S1 and
S2.  Normal, tachycardic.  Respirations coarse breath sounds
bilaterally, decreased at bases.  Abdomen positive bowel
sounds, soft.  Extremities status post bilateral below the
knee amputation, [**Doctor First Name **] distally cool.  No palpable popliteal
pulses appreciated.  Neurological unresponsive, very sedated.

LABORATORIES FROM OUTSIDE HOSPITAL:  White blood cell count
16.3, diff segments 79, lymphocytes 13, hematocrit 39,
platelets 174.  Arterial blood gas on transfer 7.18/35/81, on
AC 500/5, FIO2 01.0.  K 3.4, glucose 172.  Electrocardiogram
sinus bradycardia at 55 beats per minute with normal axis and
intervals, Q waves in 2, 3, [**Street Address 2802**] elevations in V1 and V2.
Repeat electrocardiogram sinus tach at [**Street Address 10134**] elevations
4 to 6 mm in AVL and lead 1, V2 through V3.  Tombstone ST
elevations with a reciprocal inferolateral ST depressions.

The patient became hypotensive times two and was transitioned
to Dopamine and Levophed requiring 2 amps of epinephrine and
one amp of bicarb with IABP.  Continued to require aggressive
pressure support and appropriate monitoring.  The patient
began having 250 cc output bright red blood per nasogastric
tube anticoagulation was held on account of likely
gastrointestinal bleed.  The patient during hypotensive
episodes required CPR with adequate resuscitation of blood
pressure and rate.  Subsequent electrocardiograms revealed
attenuated voltage throughout precordial leads and limb leads
consistent with severe myocardial injury.  The family was
called at bedside and informed of guarded prognosis regarding
the patient's acute myocardial infarction.  Per wishes of
family supportive care was to be withdrawn with intentions of
possible tissue donation per organ bank.  The patient
remained unresponsive to voice, painful stimuli, noxious
stimuli, pupils fixed without corneal reflexes.  On hospital
day one IABP was stopped and vent switched to room air.  The
patient expired on [**3292-10-1**].

CAUSE OF DEATH:
1.  Acute myocardial infarction.
2.  Coronary artery disease.
3.  Type 1 diabetes.

The patient was pronounced dead without evidence of
spontaneous breathing, absent heart sounds, unreactive
pupils, organ bank was contacted for possible tissue donation
post autopsy.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      44 year old woman s/p VF arrest and LAD stent                                   
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:

                                     FINAL REPORT
     CHEST:
     
     INDICATION: S/P VF arrest and placement of LAD stent. Check positions of ETT
     and intra-aortic balloon pump.
     
     FINDINGS: A single AP semi-upright view. Prior comparison studies are not
     available for comparison due to a PACS difficulty. The ETT tip is at the level
     of the thoracic inlet, approximately 5 cm above the carina. The intra-aortic
     balloon pump tip is satisfactorily positioned at the level of the [**4-15**] rib
     interspace. A transfemoral Swan-Ganz catheter is noted with its tip in the
     pulmonary artery trunk adjacent to the right pulmonary orifice. An NG tube is
     noted with its tip just through the esophagogastric junction in the fundus. It
     could be advanced. There is evidence of moderate left ventricular enlargement,
     associated with marked upper zone redistribution and bilateral pulmonary
     interstitial infiltrates mainly in the perihilar regions and upper zones.
     These findings are consistent with moderate left ventricular failure and
     pulmonary edema. The costophrenic angles are sharp but subpulmonary effusions
     cannot be excluded.
     
     IMPRESSION: Satisfactory placement of ETT, aortic balloon pump and Swan
     catheter. The NG tube should be advanced further into the stomach. The
     findings indicate significant left heart failure.
