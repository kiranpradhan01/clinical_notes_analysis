Admission Date:  [**2707-5-6**]     Discharge Date:  [**2707-5-8**]

Date of Birth:   [**2622-7-14**]     Sex:  M

Service:  TRAUMA

ADDENDUM:

Please see the previously-dictated discharge summary dated
[**2707-5-8**] for initial history of present illness and initial
hospital course.

Since the previous dictation, it has been found that the
patient had significant aspirations when resuming PO intake.
Bedside evaluation showed significant aspiration with thin
liquids.  Videoscopic swallowing evaluation similarly
confirmed premature spillage of contents in the vallecula and
piriform sinuses.  He had reduced epiglottic deflection and
laryngeal elevation.  There was deep laryngeal penetration
during swallow with subsequent frank aspiration.  There was
no cough.  There was also suggestion of an intraluminal mass
at the level of the cricopharyngeus or slightly below.  The
patient was made NPO.  Subsequent ENT consultation was
obtained.  [**Last Name (un) 10097**] scope failed to demonstrate the mass and
plans are being developed for an outpatient rigid
esophagoscopy.  As the patient will be NPO for an unknown
period of time, nutrition is significant concern in his
recovery.  Permission was obtained and a percutaneous
endoscopic gastrostomy jejunostomy tube was placed by the
Interventional Radiology Department on [**2707-5-10**].  It was
subsequently used to start tube feeds on [**2707-5-11**].  The
patient's tube feedings have been advanced to goal with no
difficultly.  Of note, blue dye was mixed in with the tube
feeds and he has never had any laryngeal or pharyngeal
evidence of tube feedings.  The patient continued to work
with the Department of Physical Therapy who state that the
patient is definitely in need of rehabilitation prior to any
discharge home.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/MEDICATIONS:  Please note, all
medications should be crushed and administered through the
J-tube.  Mirtazapine 15 mg p.o.q.h.s.; Sertraline 200 mg p.o.
q.d.; Captopril 25 mg p.o.t.i.d. hold for systolic less than
120; Xanax .25 mg per G-tube; ....................1%, one
drop OU b.i.d.; tamsulosin .04 mg per J-tube q.h.s.;
Latanoprost, one drop OU q.h.s.; Colace 100 mg per J-tube
t.i.d.; Atenolol 12.5 mg per J-tube q.d.; Ritalin 10 mg per
J-tube b.i.d.; Oxybutynin 5 mg per J-tube b.i.d.; Zantac
elixir 150 mg per J-tube b.i.d.; Neutra-Phos, one packet per
J-tube b.i.d.; and Tylenol 650 mg per J-tube q.4h. to 6h.
p.r.n.  The patient is received Promote with fiber 75 cc per
hour continuous tube feedings, as well as 250 cc water
boluses q.6h.

As separate sheet is being attached for care of the
percutaneous gastrostomy-jejunostomy tube.  Dressing should
be changed daily and the skin cleansed with Povidone iodine
or dilute hydrogen peroxide.  Catheter should be checked for
security every shift.  Phone numbers to call in case there
are catheter difficulties are included on the other sheet.
Cotton roll and suture removal should take place in seven to
take days, note it was placed on [**2707-5-10**].  The cotton roll
skin anchors should be removed by using scissors, snip the
black suture underneath the cotton roll while retracting the
cotton roll off to one side.  Cut the black suture flush
where it enters the skin.  The roll is then thrown away.  The
remaining suture, under the skin, will retract inside.

Please note:  The patient should followup with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of Ear, Nose, and Throat Surgery at office
#[**Telephone/Fax (1) 852**] within the next seven to ten days.  The patient
should also followup with his primary care physician,
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].  [**Last Name (STitle) 10098**] in the next one to two weeks and to followup in
the Trauma Clinic, [**Telephone/Fax (1) 91**] within the next one to two
weeks.

Of note:  The patient has had significant difficulty
urinating when the Foley catheter has been removed.  She has
had problems with this in the past.  We would recommended the
Foley catheter be attempted to be removed and another voiding
trial attempted within the next 36 to 48 hours.  If the
patient continues to have trouble, the primary care doctor,
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10098**] should be notified.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Status post SDH with recent aspiration risk demonstrated on video
     swallow and requirement for longterm nutrition.
     
     PROCEDURE/MEDICATIONS/FINDINGS:  Written and signed informed consent was
     obtained from the patient. The patient was placed supine on the angiography
     table. The area overlying the upper abdomen was prepped and draped in sterile
     fashion, and 1% Lidocaine was infiltrated into the subcutaneous tissues
     overlying the stomach.
     Conscious sedation was monitored by the nursing staff, and 0.5 mg of Versed
     and 25 mg of Fentanyl were administered. Additionally, the patient experienced
     a mild increase in systolic blood pressure which was treated with one inch of
     chest wall Nitropaste.
     
     The stomach was insufflated with air via an NG tube. A window through the
     anterior abdominal wall to the stomach antrum was identified and multiple
     fluoroscopic projections showed no interposing bowel loops. A single wall
     needle holding [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2718**]-[**Doctor Last Name 2719**] T-fastener was inserted into the stomach, with
     subsequent aspiration of gas. A small injection of contrast pooled within the
     antrum. The T-fastener was then deployed, the delivery needle withdrawn, and
     the external suture fixed in place.  This procedure was followed two more
     times at the apices of a 1 cm equilateral triangle.
     
     The single wall needle was then passed through the center of this triangle to
     the stomach and position again confirmed by draw back of gas and pooling of
     contrast within the antrum after injection through the bore. A 0.035 guide
     wire was placed into the stomach through the needle lumen, and the needle was
     exchanged for a 7-French sheath set. The guide wire was withdrawn and replaced
     with an 0.035 Amplatz SuperStiff wire, which was extended through the stomach
     into the proximal duodenum. The wire was advanced beyond the angle of Treitz.
     The sheath set was withdrawn and 10- and 12-French dilators were passed along
     the subcutaneous tract and into the stomach. These were removed and replaced
     with a 14-French peel-away sheath. The central core of the sheath was removed
     and replaced with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 939**] gastrojejunostomy catheter which was easily passed
     into the stomach, along the duodenal C-sweep and into the proximal jejunum.
     The final few centimeters of advancement occurred as the sheath was peeled
     away. The thread on the [**Doctor Last Name 939**] catheter was then retracted after a loop was
                                                                 (Over)

     (Cont)
     formed by a torsion on the catheter.
     
     A confirmatory overhead radiograph was obtained after injection of contrast
     through the catheter lumen, demonstrating passage of contrast through the
     distal port and into the proximal small bowel. The proximal portion of the
     catheter was then afixed to the abdominal wall with a subcutaneous suture (0-
     prolene) and an adhesive fixation (FlexiTrack). The procedural site was
     cleaned off and adhesive bandage applied over the area.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: The patient tolerated the procedure without complication and
     was returned to the floor.
     
     IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated percutaneous G-J tube placement. The G-J tube can be
     used 24 hours after placement.
