History of Present Illness:
 [**Age over 90 **] y/o transferred from Mt. [**Hospital 10836**] Hospital after being found

responsive only to painful stimuluoi. He was tranported to [**Last Name (un) 1229**] 
where he was found to have a large, Lt. - sided SDH with midline 
shift, GCS of 4. He was also found to have an INR of 4.1 - he is 
on coumadin for atrial fibrillation as an outpatient. 
Transferred here for neurosurgery after being given FFP and 
Vitamin K. On arrival here, pupils were dilated to 5 mm without 
response to light. Neurosurgery was consulted, and they feel 
that there would be no meaningful recovery from this injury and 
no therefore no indication for intervention. A discussion was 
started with the family about the withdrawal of care, and they 
have decided to make him DNR, but would like other measures 
undertaken short of compressions and shocks at the time of my 
evaluation.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Short of breath, CHF.
     
     CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW. No previous chest x-rays on PACS record for comparison.
     
     ET tube in satisfactory position approximately 4.1 cm above the carina.  No
     CHF, focal infiltrate, or effusion detected.  A tiny right apical pneumothorax
     would be difficult to exclude.  The lungs are hyperinflated, suggesting
     background COPD, with some distortion of interstitial markings. Osteopenia and
     degenerative changes of the spine. Aortic calcification.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     ET tube in satisfactory position.  Background COPD. A tiny right apical
     pneumothorax cannot be excluded.   Otherwise, no definite acute superimposed
     process.

     Pt is a [**Age over 90 **] yo male, who had been to the [**Name8 (MD) **] MD earlier in the day.  Returned home, had lunch, and ~1pm, pt's wife noted that he wasn't making sense when speaking.  He increasingly became lethargic and EMS was called.  Transferred to [**Hospital6 **].  Pt arrived with an INR of 4.1 (on coumadin for chronic AF). Intubated for airway protection.  A CT  revealed a  large left sided subdural bleed with midline shift.  Given Vit K and FFP and transferred to [**Hospital1 10**].  Neuro evaluated on arrival, no intervention due to severity of bleed.   Transferred to MICU for supportive care.

After much discussion, pt's wife, [**Doctor First Name 427**], their daughter, [**Doctor First Name 963**], and son [**Name (NI) 1199**], decided on comfort measures only.
