     COMPARISON:  [**3293-10-22**].
     
     INDICATION:  Pre-operative assessment for hip replacement.
     
     There has been prior median sternotomy.  Heart is upper limits of normal in
     size.  Aorta is diffusely tortuous and calcified with likely component of
     dilation in the ascending region, not significantly changed.  Diffuse
     interstitial lung disease is present with peripheral and basilar predominance.
     Left hemidiaphragm is moderately elevated, but without change.
     
     Correlative chest CT of [**3293-11-19**] confirms mild dilation of ascending
     aorta and also demonstrates interstitial fibrosis and emphysema.
     
     Finally, note is made of prior wedge resection in left upper lobe.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Stable chest radiographic appearance with pulmonary fibrosis,
     elevated left hemidiaphragm, and tortuous and mildly dilated aorta.

HIP UNILAT MIN 2 VIEWS LEFT

FINDINGS: Comparison to [**3293-1-19**]. Postoperative changes status 
post placement of a left total hip replacement with noncemented 
acetabular component fixed with two screws and a cemented 
femoral stem are noted. Gas is seen in the soft tissues. Clips 
are seen along the skin laterally. There is also a right total 
hip prosthesis with noncemented acetabular component fixed with 
one screw and a noncemented femoral stem, incompletely evaluated 
on the current study. Degenerative changes of the lower lumbar 
spine are seen. There is vascular calcification. A calcified 
structure in the pelvis may represent a calcified fibroid. No 
hardware-related complication of periprosthetic lucency is seen.

IMPRESSION:

Bilateral total hip prostheses without evidence of 
hardware-related complication.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] was admitted to [**Hospital1 19**] on [**3294-1-19**] for an elective left 
total hip replacement. Pre-operatively, she was consented, 
prepped, and brought down to the operating room for surgery. 
Intra-operatively, she was closely monitored and remained 
hemodynamically stable. She tolerated the procedure well without 
any difficulty or complication. Post-operatively, she was 
transferred to the PACU and floor for further recovery. On the 
floor,she remained hemodynamically stable with her pain 
controlled. She progressed with physical therapy to improve her 
strength and mobility. She continues to make steady progress 
without any incidents. She was discharged in stable condition.

     FINDINGS:  Compared with [**3294-1-7**], as well as prior studies from September and

     pulmonary vascular upper zone redistribution consistent with mild CHF, but no
     overt pulmonary edema.
     
     There are prominent interstitial markings in the right mid and lower lung
     fields laterally, which are chronic.  There is also some focal
     atelectasis/scarring above the left hemidiaphragm related to its chronic
     elevation.  No obvious pulmonary infiltrates are seen.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Mild CHF / fluid overload, superimposing chronic changes.

     INDICATION:  76-year-old woman status post resected lung cancer, the left
     upper lobe.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3293-11-19**].
     
     TECHNIQUE: Multidetector, helically-acquired axial images were obtained from
     the thoracic inlet to the lung bases without IV contrast.  5 mm and 1.25 mm
     axial and 5 mm coronal reconstructed images were obtained.
     
     CT CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Post-surgical changes from prior surgery within
     the left upper lobe are stable and demonstrated an expected postoperative
     appearance. There is minimal triangular residual soft tissue along the
     anterior chest wall, which is smaller in comparison to prior study, and likely
     represents post- surgical change.  No evidence of disease recurrence in the
     surgical bed. Again seen are extensive changes related to underlying
     emphysema. Additionally, there is moderate pulmonary fibrosis bilaterally,
     which is stable in comparison to prior study.
     
     The aortic and coronary artery calcification is again seen.  The configuration
     of the aorta, including enlargement of the ascending aorta (4.3 cm, 2:26) and
     extensive atherosclerotic plaque and likely chronic dissection (2:49) is
     stable in comparison to prior study.  The enlargement of the abdominal aorta
     (3.8 x 2.9 cm, 2:49) is unchanged.  No enlarged mediastinal or hilar
     lymphadenopathy is identified by CT imaging criteria.  No pleural or
     pericardial effusions are seen.
     
     This study is not designed to evaluate structures below the diaphragm.  A
     focal splenic calcification is stable in comparison to the prior study.  There
     is a small left adrenal nodule measuring 11.8 x 9.0 mm (2:49), which likely
     represents an adenoma, and on retrospective review of the prior study, is
     unchanged.  A hypodensity is seen within the superior pole of the left kidney,
     which is not completely characterized (2:47).
     
     Degenerative changes are seen within the thoracic spine.  No new suspicious
     lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Expected stable postoperative changes within the left upper lobe, without
     evidence for disease recurrence.
     2.  Extensive emphysema and moderate pulmonary fibrosis, unchanged.

     due to lung cancer.
     
     COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from [**3294-1-19**] and chest CT from [**3294-4-8**].
     
     The heart size is mildly enlarged but unchanged.  Tortuous and heavily
     calcified aorta again demonstrated.  The left lung volume is decreased due to
     resection of left upper lobe with stable post-surgical appearance.  The
     subpleural interstitial abnormalities predominantly involving the lung bases
     represent a known honeycombing most likely related to IPF.
     
     There is no pleural effusion or evidence of congestive heart failure.

     AP PELVIS AND TWO VIEWS BILATERAL HIPS:  Moderate degenerative changes are

     sacrum.
     
     The patient is status post bilateral total hip arthroplasty.  On the right,
     the femoral head prosthesis overlies the center of the acetabular component on
     all three views.  There is no fracture or malalignment of the hardware, no
     evidence of hardware loosening.  Cerclage wire within the greater trochanter
     is fractured in the interval since [**3293-7-17**].  On the left, the prosthetic
     femoral head overlies the acetabular component on all views.  There is no
     malalignment of the hardware, or evidence of hardware loosening.  Productive
     bony changes overlie the lesser trochanter.  There is no evidence of fracture.
     Marked atherosclerotic calcifications are seen bilaterally.  There is a
     calcified fibroid within the pelvis.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Status post bilateral total hip arthroplasty without malalignment
