PORTABLE ABDOMEN  [**2659-7-4**] 2:10 AM
NG tube is in fundus of stomach. There is gaseous distention of 
the colon essentially unchanged since the prior study of [**7-3**], 04. Right pleural thickening/calcification. 

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2659-7-4**] 8:11 AM

CHEST, AP: The NGT is seen entering the stomach with the tip at 
the distal stomach or proximal duodenum. Massively dilated large 
bowel is again noted. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar 
contours are stable in appearance. Diffuse bilateral patchy 
infiltrates are again noted and stable in appearance. The left 
side of the chest is not included with the view of the image. 
The osseous and soft tissue structures are stable in appearance.

IMPRESSION: NGT with tip at distal stomach or proximal duodenum. 
Overall unchanged radiographic appearance of the chest and 
abdomen compared to prior study. 

RENAL U.S.  [**2659-7-3**] 4:43 PM
The left kidney measures 8.5 cm. The right kidney measures 7.8 
cm. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis. A simple cyst is 
seen at the upper pole of the right kidney measuring 1.7 cm. A 
simple cyst is seen at the lower pole of the right kidney 
measuring 3.0 cm. Two simple cysts are identified at the upper 
pole of the left kidney measuring 3.8 and 3.5 cm respectively.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of hydronephrosis. Unchanged examination 
when compared to [**2659-6-30**].

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2659-7-1**] 12:09 PM

The patient is status post median sternotomy and coronary artery 
bypass surgery. A permanent pacemaker remains in place with 
leads unchanged in position. There is stable cardiac enlargement 
and stable mediastinal widening. Vascular engorgement and 
perihilar haziness are again noted. There has been overall 
increase in degree of perihilar haziness and worsening of 
thickened septal lines. An asymmetrical area of confluent 
opacity in the right perihilar region is also noted adjacent to 
an area of calcified pleural thickening. There is probably also 
an associated right pleural effusion. Within the imaged portion 
of the upper abdomen, distention of the stomach and adjacent 
bowel loops is noted.

Comparison is also made to older chest radiographs dating back 
to [**2654-11-13**]. The bilateral mediastinal widening and 
calcified pleural thickening were present on the older 
radiograph.

IMPRESSION: Worsening congestive heart failure. It is difficult 
to fully exclude an area of pneumonia in the right lower lobe 
and follow-up radiographs are recommended following diuresis. 

ECHO Study Date of [**2659-6-28**]   
Conclusions:  
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is 
moderately  
dilated.  
2. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is 
severe global  
left ventricular hypokinesis. LV systolic function appears 
depressed.  
3. The right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular 
systolic  
function appears depressed.  
4. A bileaflet mitral valve prosthesis is present. The mitral 
prosthesis  
appears well seated, with normal leaflet motion and 
transvalvular gradients.  
5. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.  

KNEE (AP, LAT & OBLIQUE) LEFT  [**2659-6-28**] 2:02 PM

LEFT KNEE THREE VIEWS [**2659-6-28**]; The bones are diffusely 
demineralized. There is a small suprapatellar joint effusion. No 
evidence for fracture dislocation. Vascular calcification and 
clips are noted. No erosions. Diffuse subcutaneous edema appears 
to be present.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
1. Cardiac:
CHF: The patient's lasix was initially held secondary to 
depleted volume status on exam and acute on chronic renal 
failure, possibly pre-renal. 
HTN: The patient was continued on Captopril, Isosorbide DN, and 
a beta-blocker.
CAD: The patient was continued on a statin, B-blocker, and 
isosorbide DN.
MVR: The patient's coumadin was initially held as the patient 
was supratherapeutic at 5.4 INR. An echo was obtained which 
revealed severe TR and severely depressed systolic function.
Arrhythmia: The patient was continued on Amiodarone for 
paroxysmal AFib.

2. Neuro: CT head negative for acute thrombosis/bleed. He had no 
focal deficits on exam, and his weakness was thought to be 
overall global weakness related to deconditioning and chronic 
microvascular infarcts.

3. Renal: mild acute on chronic renal failure
 Likely pre-renal, gently replete fluids given h/o CHF. His 
lasix was originally held.

4. Derm: 
PSORIASIS: The patient initially refused treatment of his 
psoriasis. Dermatology was asked to consult on the patient and 
recommended topical treatment which he agreed to. 
CELLULITIS: The patient was started on Cefazolin 1 gm IV Q12 on 
[**2659-6-27**] empirically

5. Endocrine:
HYPOTHYROIDISM: Continue levothyroxine.

6. Musculo:
PT, OT c/s'd on [**2659-6-27**] re: weakness, fall precautions, risk 
stratification. 
-History of gout and his uric acid was elevated. The left knee 
was tapped and found to have urate crystals and elevated WBC - 
could not rule out septic arthritis. Colchicine o.6 mg was given 
on [**2659-6-29**]. Salumedrol and Prednisone were started on [**2659-6-30**] with 
taper.

9.Derm: Recommended by dermatology to have bacitracin to left 
shin wound and take davonex ointment BID for psoriasis -which he 
should receive as an outpatient.

10. GI - history of Olgivie's
KUB showed distended bowel. His LFTs and lipase were mildly 
elevated with a mild elevation in CK. As a result, his statin 
was discontinued. The patient should be continued on Zetia as an 
outpatient.

11. DNR/DNI.

Pt was transferred to MICU on [**7-3**] for acute hypoxic 
respiratory distress and increasing abdominal distension.  He 
was placed on BiPAP, started on natrecor for CHF, NGT and rectal 
tubes placed for decompression, pressors (dopamine) for 
hypotension, empiric abx to cover pulm and GI sources.  Pt 
developed worsening ARF from ATN (likely from hypotension). On 
[**7-4**] team met with family and pt was made CMO.  The patient 
passed away on [**2659-7-5**].

     TWO VIEW CHEST OF [**2659-7-1**] COMPARED TO [**2659-6-27**].
     
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Cough.
     
     The patient is status post median sternotomy and coronary artery bypass
     surgery.  A permanent pacemaker remains in place with leads unchanged in
     position.  There is stable cardiac enlargement and stable mediastinal
     widening.  Vascular engorgement and perihilar haziness are again noted.  There
     has been overall increase in degree of perihilar haziness and worsening of
     thickened septal lines.  An asymmetrical area of confluent opacity in the
     right perihilar region is also noted adjacent to an area of calcified pleural
     thickening.  There is probably also an associated right pleural effusion.
     Within the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, distention of the stomach and
     adjacent bowel loops is noted.
     
     Comparison is also made to older chest radiographs dating back to [**2654-11-13**].  The bilateral mediastinal widening and calcified pleural thickening
     were present on the older radiograph.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Worsening congestive heart failure.  It is difficult to fully
     exclude an area of pneumonia in the right lower lobe and follow-up radiographs
     are recommended following diuresis.

     CHEST AP SINGLE VIEW.
     
     INDICATION: Respiratory failure, pulmonary edema.
     
     FINDINGS: 1 AP single view of the chest includes also the upper abdominal area
     demonstrating marked gas distention of large bowel apparently compromising
     diaphragmatic excursions. The patient is s/p sternotomy and previous bypass
     surgery. The heart silhouette is markedly enlarged. Bilaterally, patchy
     infiltrates are noted more on the right than on the left base. Also on the
     right side, the pleural sinus is blunted. A permanent pacer is noted in right
     axillary position connected to a 2 electrode system one of which terminating
     in a position compatible with a right atrium superolateral wall. The second
     ventricular electrode is in an unusual position pointing cranially. Review of
     the previous AP & lateral examination of [**7-1**] demonstrates that the
     electrode is directed anteriorly and thus most likely connects with the
     anterior upper portion of the intraventricular septum. Comparison with the
     next previous examination demonstrates practically unchanged pulmonary
     cardiovascular findings apparently aggravated by the more increasing gas
     distended bowel and stomach.
