Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:  85yoM with h/o CAD s/p CABG, CHF (EF 33%), HTN, HL p/w 
chest pain
.
1.  CAD: Pt was started on heparin gtt and nitro gtt (for relief 
of CP) and underwent cardiac cath the morning after admission. 
His cath showed severe 3-vessel disease with patent SVG to LAD 
and patent SVG to RCA. There was a moderate lesion in the distal 
SVG to PDA but it was not flow-limiting and was unchanged from 
the prior cath. (See separate report). Pain likely from small 
vessel (nonintervenable) disease, and pt poor surgical 
candidate, so plan for optimization of medical management. 
Continued aspirin, Plavix, pravastatin, carvedilol. Pt continued 
to have intermittant CP with ECG changes, relieved with SL NTG 
and then NTG gtt.
.
2. CHF: On admission pt appeared slightly volume-overloaded but 
had no SOB. After the cardiac cath he had increasing SOB; PCWP 
was elevated on cath, suggesting fluid overload worsened by 
lying flat. Pt was diuresed with IV lasix with transient 
improvement in exam and sx, but then worsening SOB requiring 
NRB, likely from combination of serious bilateral aspiration 
pneumonia and CHF. Multiple increasing doses of IV lasix with 
metolazone tried with poor response. Discussed goals of care 
multiple times with pt & family and pt did not want intubation, 
esp given poor cardiac status and very small likelihood of quick 
extubation and recovery. Palliative care consulted. Pt initially 
continued on NTG gtt as tolerated by BP, however remained 
hypoxic on NRB with dropping BP. CP much worse off NTG gtt; 
goals of care readdressed with pt & family and NTG gtt restarted 
at low dose with morphine gtt for comfort. He expired the next 
morning ([**2988-2-21**]) at 10:10am. The family declined an autopsy and 
the case was not referred to the medical examiner.
.
3. Aspiration pneumonia: Post-cath pt vomited and CXR showed 
bilateral infiltrates concerning for aspiration. Started on 
levo/flagyl. Repeat CXR showed worsening infiltrates; abx 
changed to zosyn/vanc. Patient's status continued to worsen 
despite IV abx and he became hypoxic, likely from combination of 
pneumonia and CHF (see above).
.
4. CRI: Per PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 10159**] Cr>2 (up to 2.7 in past). 1.7 on 
admission, rose to 2.6 day after cath. Received precath 
hydration with bicarb/mucomyst. All medications renally-dosed.
.
5. HTN:  stable; continued carvidolol, Imdur, Norvasc. 
.
6. HL:  controlled on Zetia, prevastatin
.
7. Carotid artery stenosis:  asymptomatic, patient being 
evaluated for possible stenting
