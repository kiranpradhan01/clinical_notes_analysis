Brief Hospital Course:
1.) Pulmonary: The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] intubated. 
He was electively intubated at [**Hospital 508**] Hospital prior to 
bronchoscopy there and remained intubated in anticipation of 
further possible intervention. After arrival, overnight he was 
maintained on AC on the vent. He had a chest CT overnight which 
showed 
--Perihilar lung mass measuring 4.0 x 2.9 cm causing occlusion 
of the lower lobe branches to the left main pulmonary artery, 
narrowing of the left proximal mainstem bronchus, and post 
obstructive consolidation.  
--Diffuse interstitial consolidation in the right upper lobe and 
dependent consolidation in the right lower lobe with appearance 
most typical for aspiration pneumonia.  
--Bilateral pleural effusions, large in the left and small to 
moderate in the right.  
--Diffuse metastasis to multiple ribs and the T1 vertebral body, 
as well as to the left adrenal gland.  
In the AM [**2879-10-24**] the patient had a bedside thoracentesis both 
therapeutic and diagnostic analyzing his left pleural effusion. 
The effusion was exudative based on the lab results (see above). 
A bronchoscopy was performed and no endobronchial lesions were 
seen. The bronchioles were patent and a stent was not placed. 
The patient will be continued on Levofloxacin and Flagyl for the 
possibility of a post-obstructive pneumonia. The results of the 
pleural fluid cytology are still pending at the time of transfer 
back to [**Hospital 508**] hospital so it is unclear as to whether the 
effusion was malignant(associated with lung CA) or [**12-19**] 
infection. The patient was extubated on [**2879-10-25**] in the morning 
without complication. He was evalutated at the bedside by Dr. 
[**Last Name (STitle) **] and the interventional pulmonary team using 
ultrasound which did not reveal any reaccumulation of pleural 
fluid at the thoracentesis site. 

2. CV: The patient has a history of HTN. At home he takes 
atenolol, this was initially held on transfer because the 
patient's BP was low. On the day of extubation, the patient's BP 
had normalized and he had an episode of tachycardia and 
persistent HTN s/p extubation. He was restarted on his atenolol 
and was given 10 mg IV hydralazine and may continue this Q6H for 
today during transfer. His BP regimen may need to be readressed 
at [**Hospital 508**] Hospital

3. NSC-lung CA: The patient has significant pain related to his 
mets. He was on IV morphine in the hospital. On transfer he was 
written for PO morphine SR and IR. 

4. Adrenal insufficiency: On transfer, the patient was on 
solumedrol for presumed adrenal insufficiency. A cortisol level 
was drawn here and the level was markedly high, indicating the 
steroids can be tapered and removed. The patient should be 
placed on PO prednisone at [**Hospital 508**] hospital and an appropriate 
taper started.

5. FEN: The patient was initially NPO for the procedure, but at 
the time of discharge was restarted on a regular diet.

     INDICATION: Lung cancer.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Multidetector, contrasts enhanced images of the chest were
     performed following the administration of 150 cc of IV Optiray.
     
     IV CONTRAST: Nonionic IV Optiray contrast was used for the patient's debility.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST: There is a soft tissue constricting lesion seen
     in the proximal left mainstem bronchus as well as a mass in the left perihilar
     region measuring 4.0 x 2.9 cm which is causing occlusion of the lower lobe
     vessels of the left main pulmonary artery.  There are bilateral pleural
     effusions, small to moderate on the right and large on the left.  Left lower
     lobe postobstructive collapse/consolidation is seen.  On the right, there is
     a smooth ovoid soft tissue density within the right bronchus intermedius,
     possibly mucous or hemorrhage.  Apical blebs and mild upper lobe emphysema is
     noted.
     
     There is diffuse interstitial consolidation and ground glass opacity seen in
     the right upper lobe and more confluent consolidation more dependently within
     the right lower lobe. The heart is normal in size, and there is no pericardial
     effusion. Multiple rib metastatic lesions are appreciated.  Two involvr the
     left third rib, one posteiorly and the other anteriorly.  Another lesion is
     seen involving the left fourth rib anteriorly. On the right, there is a lesion
     in the seventh rib posteriorly and in the fifth rib anteriorly.  In addition,
     there is a lytic lesion involving the T1 vertebral body and its left pedicle
     and lamina.
     
     Within the imaged portions of the upper abdomen, a large perisplenic hematoma
     is noted measuring 14 x 9.8 cm, presumably related to recent rupture of a
     splenic aneurysm which is now status post coiling.  There is a large
     heterogeneous metastatic adrenal lesion measuring 6.5 x 3.7 cm.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Perihilar lung mass measuring 4.0 x 2.9 cm causing occlusion of the
     lower lobe branches to the left main pulmonary artery, narrowing of the left
     proximal mainstem bronchus, and post obstructive consolidation.
     2.  Diffuse interstitial consolidation in the right upper lobe and dependent
     consolidation in the right lower lobe with appearance most typical for
     aspiration pneumonia.
     3.  Bilateral pleural effusions, large in the left and small to moderate in
                                                                 (Over)

     vessels of the left main pulmonary artery.  There are bilateral pleural
     effusions, small to moderate on the right and large on the left.  Left lower
     lobe postobstructive collapse/consolidation is seen.  On the right, there is
     a smooth ovoid soft tissue density within the right bronchus intermedius,
     possibly mucous or hemorrhage.  Apical blebs and mild upper lobe emphysema is
     noted.
     
     There is diffuse interstitial consolidation and ground glass opacity seen in
     the right upper lobe and more confluent consolidation more dependently within
     the right lower lobe. The heart is normal in size, and there is no pericardial
     effusion. Multiple rib metastatic lesions are appreciated.  Two involvr the
     left third rib, one posteiorly and the other anteriorly.  Another lesion is
     seen involving the left fourth rib anteriorly. On the right, there is a lesion
     in the seventh rib posteriorly and in the fifth rib anteriorly.  In addition,
     there is a lytic lesion involving the T1 vertebral body and its left pedicle
     and lamina.
     
     Within the imaged portions of the upper abdomen, a large perisplenic hematoma
     is noted measuring 14 x 9.8 cm, presumably related to recent rupture of a
     splenic aneurysm which is now status post coiling.  There is a large
     heterogeneous metastatic adrenal lesion measuring 6.5 x 3.7 cm.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Perihilar lung mass measuring 4.0 x 2.9 cm causing occlusion of the
     lower lobe branches to the left main pulmonary artery, narrowing of the left
     proximal mainstem bronchus, and post obstructive consolidation.
     2.  Diffuse interstitial consolidation in the right upper lobe and dependent
     consolidation in the right lower lobe with appearance most typical for
     aspiration pneumonia.
     3.  Bilateral pleural effusions, large in the left and small to moderate in
                                                                 (Over)

Pt. with non small cell lung cancer with mets to bone and adrenal glands tranferred here yesterday for stent placement as tumor is surrounding L mainstem.  
Neuro: Pt. sedated on 3mg of MS04 and 40mcg of propofol.  Pt. is quite sedated on this.  Does not follow commands.  Outside hospital stated pt. was quite agitated when sedation is lightened. 

CV: BP 110-150/70's.  A line placed last night. Given bolus of propofol when BP in 150 range for presumed pain.  HR 90-105 sinus rhythm with few APC's.  IV D51/2 NS infusing at 150/hr.  Pt. had 3 fluid boluses for low urine output-felt to be dry.  Urine output picking up to 50-60cc/hr.  Address IVF after this liter of fluid is infused.

Resp: Vented on AC 40% 500x14 with 5 PEEP.  On 10 breaths pC02 was in 60's.  Now 55 (7.44/55/120).  Outside hospital reporeted L lung collapse but ct here showed bilateral expansion of lungs.  Formal report pnd.  Was ordered for sputum cx but unable to obtain due to very little secretions.   Breath sounds slightly diminished on L.  Plan to have stent placement today.

GI: Was on TPN at outside hospital-has been NPO since here covered with sliding scale insulin.  No BM. 

GU: Foley draining clear yellow urine.

ID: Afebrile.  Started on Vanco and levo for possible pneumonia.  Blood cx x 2 obtained.   

Social: wife called-she would like to be called at work after procedure is completed. (number in front of chart)
