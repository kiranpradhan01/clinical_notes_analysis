     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with h/o Afib, CAD, pneumonia now with acute onset SOB today
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      post intubation xray
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Assess endotracheal tube and central line position in patient
     with large left pleural effusion.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2737-5-25**], approximately one hour prior to the present study.
     
     AP AND LEFT LATERAL DECUBITUS CHEST:  In the interval since the prior study,
     an endotracheal tube has been placed and the tip is located approximately 6.5
     cm above the carina.  The right IJ central line tip is well positioned in the
     mid-SVC.  There is no pneumothorax.
     
     There is marked improvement in the appearance of the chest since the prior
     study.  The previously described large layering left pleural effusion is
     markedly reduced in size and appears now as a small pleural effusion with
     blunting of the left costophrenic angle.  There is minimal blunting of the
     right costophrenic angle suggesting a small right pleural effusion as well.
     Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with associated atelectatic changes
     in the left lower lobe.  Minimal atelectasis is also noted in the right base.
     The lungs are otherwise clear.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal
     and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Calcified lymph nodes are present. The
     pulmonary vasculature does not appear engorged.
     
     The left lateral decubitus film is difficult to assess for layering pleural
     effusion secondary to overlying soft tissues.
     
     Calcification is noted in the splenic artery.  No osseous abnormalities are
     identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Marked interval improvement in the appearance of bilateral pleural
     effusions with small effusions remaining.  There is associated lower lobe
     atelectasis.
     2.  Well positioned endotracheal tube and right IJ central venous line with no
     evidence of pneumothorax.

     HISTORY:  Atrial fibrillation and CAD. Now with acute onset of shortness of
     breath.  Rule out pneumonia.
     
     COMPARISONS: None.
     
     SUPINE AP CHEST:  There is almost complete opacification of the right
     hemithorax secondary to left lower lobe and lingular consolidation, as well as
     possible posterior layering of pleural effusion.  The cardiac, mediastinal and
     hilar contours cannot be assessed due to obscuration from left hemithorax.
     Partial obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm could represent right lower
     lobe consolidation.  A right sided pleural effusion with posterior layering is
     also possible. The osseous structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Limited evaluation of the chest. Opacities in bilateral lower
     lobes and lingula could represent an infectious process.  Bilateral layering
     pleural effusions are also present.

     CHEST, AP:  Comparison is made to the prior film dated [**2737-5-25**].  The ETT is
     noted, which appears to be in good position.  Also noted is a right-sided IJ
     line, with the tip at the junction of the distal SVC and the right atrium.
     NGT is also noted, with the tip extending to the abdomen.  There is evidence
     of bilateral pleural effusions, right slightly greater than left.  The left
     hemidiaphragm is not visualized, consistent with left lower lobe
     collapse/consolidation.  Also noted is slight upper zone redistribution,
     consistent with mild pulmonary edema.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Persistent bilateral pleural effusions, right slightly greater
     than left.  Persistent left lower lobe collapse/consolidation.  Mild CHF.
