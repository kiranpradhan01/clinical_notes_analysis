CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Motor vehicle crash.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is an 82-year-old male
involved in a high speech motor vehicle crash, which was
head-on.  The patient was a driver of a vehicle that collided
head-on into a tractor trailer.  The patient was
unrestrained, and there was airbag deployment.  Patient was
found unresponsive at the scene.  Patient was intubated
without difficulty at the scene.  Patient had flaccid
extremities during the initial assessment.  The patient was
transferred to an outside hospital, stabilized, and then
transferred to [**Hospital1 10**] for
further treatment.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass
graft.
2. Hypertension.
3. Hypercholesterolemia.
4. Benign prostate hyperplasia.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Terazosin 5 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Simvastatin 20 mg p.o. q.d.
5. Finasteride 5 mg p.o. q.d.

ALLERGIES:  Unknown.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 96.6, pulse
86, blood pressure 145/74, respiratory rate 20, and O2
saturation is 100%, intubated.  General:  Patient is sedated,
unresponsive to voice.  Eyes open spontaneously.  Pupils are
equal and reactive, but sluggish 3 to 2 bilaterally.
Oropharynx is clear.  Trachea is midline.  Regular rate and
rhythm.  Patient was clear to auscultation with equal breath
sounds.  Abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended.  The
pelvis was stable.  The back had no step-offs or deformities.
Rectal tone was decreased, but guaiac negative.  Patient had
footdrop bilaterally with cool feet.  Right knee was swollen
and both knees had abrasions.

LABORATORIES:  Initial white cell count 9.5, hematocrit 38.8,
platelets 138.  Chem-7:  144, 4.2, 109, 24, 23, 1.1, glucose
152, lactate 2.2.  The coags:  14, 29.2, and 1.3.  Fibrinogen
225.  Amylase 145.

Head CT at the outside hospital was negative.  C spine CT
showed a C2 fracture.  Abdomen and pelvis CT showed 4 x 4.5
cm intramural thrombus, but no extravasation.  The bladder
was normal.

X-rays of the right knee showed no fractures.  X-rays of the
right hand show a questionable old fracture on the thumb.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Trauma
service and monitored in the Intensive Care Unit.
Neurosurgery was consulted immediately.  The Neurosurgery
service had strong concerns for a cervical cord contusion.
They requested a stat MRI and that the blood pressure be
controlled for greater than 120 systolic.  They also
recommended the patient stay in the cervical collar, and that
the Solu-Medrol be given per protocol.

During the initial part of the patient's admission, he was
hemodynamically stable.  He required initially fluid and
pressors for blood pressure control, but stabilized within
the first day.  This is most likely due to volume contraction
and neurologic shock.  The MR of the neck showed a cord
compression and contusion with a small epidural hematoma.
Neurosurgery's recommendations included keeping his blood
pressure above 120 and to his keep his coagulation studies in
the normal range.

Over the course of the next several days, the patient's
neurologic status slightly improved.  He was alert, followed
commands, but was still considered quadriplegic.  The patient
can move his left side more than his right.  His strength in
the knee left was roughly a [**2-25**].

On [**1-10**], the patient's TLS were cleared
radiographically.  Neurosurgery was slightly more optimistic
in the sense that the patient can move his upper and lower
extremities slightly more than previously.  The final read on
the TLS films were concerning for a questionable old fracture
at the T5-T6 level.  Orthopedics was consulted, and
recommended logroll precautions, and a thoracic brace until
the patient could be extubated and evaluated clinically.
They felt that the fracture was an old fracture, and that he
did not require acute interventions.

Plastic Surgery also evaluated the patient for the right hand
fracture, which was deemed to be an old injury.  Their
recommendations were to follow the patient clinically, and
there was pain in all, in the right thumb, to splint the
extremity.

On the [**1-11**], the patient was well enough to be
extubated.  Due to the large amount of secretions, the
patient was reintubated on the 21st.  At that time, the
patient still remained pseudoquadriplegic.  He could breathe
spontaneously and move his left upper extremity
spontaneously, but had minimal movement in his legs or his
right arm.

On the 22nd, a family meeting was convened, and it was
decided that the patient would continue with full support,
and that we would hold on a tracheostomy and a PEG placement
until the following week.  During that time, his neurologic
status would be evaluated.  At that time, we would also have
a better idea regarding his prognosis.

On the [**1-14**], the patient had a lower extremity
noninvasive ultrasound, which showed no evidence of DVTs.
The patient also continued with aggressive diuresis, and his
vent settings were changed to CPAP.  The patient continued to
produce a large amount of secretions and required assist
control for ventilation.  It was decided that the patient
would require a tracheostomy as his chances of weaning off
the vent are unrealistic.

A second family meeting was held, and it was decided that the
patient's wishes as dictated in his power of attorney would
limit the ICU team's actions.  His power of attorney stated
that the setting of the need for life support and/or heroic
measures to keep him alive, his decision would be to withdraw
support.

After an extensive family meeting with the patient's son, it
was decided that the patient will be made DNR/DNI, and the
patient will be extubated.  If the patient was stable, he
would continue with fully medical support.  If he became
unstable, then he would be made CMO.  Patient was extubated
and continued with respiratory distress due to the high
secretions.

On the [**1-22**], the patient continued with
respiratory distress, continued with the pseudoquadriplegia,
and was becoming hemodynamically unstable.  A decision
between the Trauma team, the ICU team, and the family was to
make the patient care measures only.

On the [**1-22**], the patient expired.  The family was
notified.

     HISTORY:  Trauma, rule out fracture.
     
     THORACIC SPINE:  Diffuse degenerative changes are appreciated.  Mid-thoracic
     vertebral body, probably T5-T6 shows some loss of height and apparent
     preservation of height posteriorly, likely osteoparotic compression fractures.
     I do not clearly seen evidence for paravertebral soft tissue swelling.  If
     suspicion for acute fracture remains, CT scan would be useful.
     
     LUMBAR SPINE:  Multiple views of the lumbar spine show significant
     hypertrophic features laterally and anteriorly.  The vertebral bodies are
     intact and normally aligned.  No evidence for fracture.
     
     IMPRESSION:  T-spine, probable old compression fracture at T4-5.  Plain films
     are limited in their ability to distinguish acuity.
     
     Lumbar spine, degenerative features with no evidence for fracture.

     THORACIC SPINE:  Diffuse degenerative changes are appreciated.  Mid-thoracic
     vertebral body, probably T5-T6 shows some loss of height and apparent
     preservation of height posteriorly, likely osteoparotic compression fractures.
     I do not clearly seen evidence for paravertebral soft tissue swelling.  If
     suspicion for acute fracture remains, CT scan would be useful.
     
     LUMBAR SPINE:  Multiple views of the lumbar spine show significant
     hypertrophic features laterally and anteriorly.  The vertebral bodies are
     intact and normally aligned.  No evidence for fracture.
     
     IMPRESSION:  T-spine, probable old compression fracture at T4-5.  Plain films
     are limited in their ability to distinguish acuity.
     
     Lumbar spine, degenerative features with no evidence for fracture.

     CLINICAL HISTORY:
     
     88 year old man status post MVA and C2 fracture on CAT scan. To rule out cord
     compression.
     
     Multiple sagittal T1 and T2 weighted images and inversion recovery images and
     multiple axial gradient images of the cervical spine are performed without
     administration of contrast.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     The visualized portion of the brain parenchyma is unremarkable.
     
     The patient has known C2 vertebral body fracture. There is extremely severe
     spinal stenosis/borderline cord compression at the level of C2 to C4. There is
     increased signal in the cord at this location suggesting contusion versus cord
     edema. In addition there is extensive increased signal noted in the FLAIR
     images in the posterior soft tissues from the level of C2 to C4 representing
     soft tissue edema/hemorrhage. Neural canal narrowing is also noted at the
     level of C2-3, C3-4 and C4-5 secondary to degenerative changes.
     
     At the level of 5-6 and [**5-29**]:
     
     Small central disc protrusion noted with no significant central or neural
     canal stenosis. 
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Known C2 fracture with associated degenerative disc changes at the level of
     C2-3, C3-4 and C4-5 thereby causing extremely severe spinal stenosis/
     borderline cord compression.
     
     2. Increased signal noted in the cord may represent contusion versus edema at
     the level of C2 and C3.
     
     3. Increased signal is noted in the soft tissues along the posterior elements
     to the level of C2 to C5 may represent edema versus hemorrhage.
     
     4. Extensive prevertebral soft tissue edema/hemorrhage noted from the level
     of C2 to C4.

Brief ROS:
Neuro- Pt. is unchanged over shift. He is awake, aware of speaker. Nods appropriately, sticks tongue out on command. He does not squeeze or push with hands or feet on command. He has, however moved his legs intermittantly throughout the shift. Notches his knees, shifts his feet- appears purposeful. Have not seen any movement of hands. Pt. c/o pain when questioned, his BP has been a concern this afternoon and he has not therefore rcv'd morphine for pain. Pupils equal and respond to light. +cough and gag. Hard collar changed over to [**Location (un) 14**] J. Solumedrol gtt in progress.

CV- Pt. was started on neo early this am(6am) for BP support. He remained on neo through MRI and afternoon with adequate BP's but the plan was to switch him to dopamine as T/SICU tm had discussed on rounds. Changed over to dopa by 3pm while he also rcv'd 2 units of FFP, pt. did not tolerate the change well. BP dropped to the 70's, requiring multiple litres of NS for fld boluses. Increased dopa from 5mcg-10mcg-12mcg. Rcv'd additional 2units FFP. Slowly pt. appears to be responding. Triple lumen placed during this period of time and cvp monitored-14, to maintain above 10.  HR increased over shift, sinus, occ PVC. EKG done. CPK's in progress.

Resp- Pt. has been vented all shift, he was put on a rate for his ""traveling"" but has since been returned to PSV, tolerated well. Sats have been adequate. Suctioned occ for thick bld tinged thick secretions. He has had a metabolic acidosis this afternoon, requiring fluid resuscitation. Rotated ETT today. 

GI- NPO. OGT advanced to attempt improved placement. Abd soft and flat. No BM.

GU- U/O dropped this afternoon with hypotensive episode, but had also drifted down previous couple of hours. Foley in place.

Skin- Back is red in the center and over the coccyx, no breakdown. Lac overforehead. Knees with sml lacs, bilat. 

Social- Son called multiple times, visited this afternoon. He drives a couple of hours to get here. Came down with his wife and his cousin also drove down. Son states that his father has been very independant and active with a significant number of friends, veterans.

     but is running low-grade temps.  Requires PICC line for IV access, multiple
     medications and possible TPN.
     
     PROCEDURE & FINDINGS:  The procedure was performed by Drs. [**Name5 (PTitle) 510**] &
     [**Doctor Last Name 346**], who was present and supervising.  The patient's left upper arm
     was prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion.  After infusion of 1%
     Lidocaine, the left basilic vein was entered with a 21-gauge needle under
     ultrasonograpic guidance.  A .018 guide wire was advanced into the SVC.  Based
     on the markers on the guide wire, it was determined that a length of 58 cm
     would be appropriate for the PICC line.  The PICC was cut to fit and advanced
     over a 4 French introducer sheath.  The wire and sheath were removed.  The
     line was flushed and heplocked.  It was secured with a Stat-lock.  Final chest
     image confirmed appropriate positioning of the PICC tip in the distal SVC. The
     patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate post-
     procedure complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of left 58-cm total length dual-lumen PICC
     line with tip in the distal SVC.  The line is ready for use.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      88 year old man C-2 fx, intubated, long term care placment pending; has central 
      line but would like to d/c today given low grade temp yesterday. 
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      please place PICC line, IV team failed at bedside.                              
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  88 y/o gentleman with C2 fracture and intubated.  Has central line
     but is running low-grade temps.  Requires PICC line for IV access, multiple
     medications and possible TPN.
     
     PROCEDURE & FINDINGS:  The procedure was performed by Drs. [**Name5 (PTitle) 510**] &
     [**Doctor Last Name 346**], who was present and supervising.  The patient's left upper arm
     was prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion.  After infusion of 1%
     Lidocaine, the left basilic vein was entered with a 21-gauge needle under
     ultrasonograpic guidance.  A .018 guide wire was advanced into the SVC.  Based
     on the markers on the guide wire, it was determined that a length of 58 cm
     would be appropriate for the PICC line.  The PICC was cut to fit and advanced
     over a 4 French introducer sheath.  The wire and sheath were removed.  The
     line was flushed and heplocked.  It was secured with a Stat-lock.  Final chest
     image confirmed appropriate positioning of the PICC tip in the distal SVC. The
     patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate post-
     procedure complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of left 58-cm total length dual-lumen PICC
     line with tip in the distal SVC.  The line is ready for use.
