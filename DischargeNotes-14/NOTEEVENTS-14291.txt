Service:  General Surgery - Blue Team

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old
young lady with a history of hypothyroid, previous
appendectomy and hysterectomy who presented to the Emergency
Department with a one day history of severe abdominal pain.
The patient endorses nausea without vomiting, sweating,
dysuria, chest pain, and shortness of breath.  The patient
did not have any prior episodes of this type of pain.  The
patient has no history of ulcers.  The patient's last bowel
movement was [**9-29**], it was normal.  The patient
tolerated breakfast by mouth today without any complications.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination the patient
was afebrile 100.0, heartrate 80, blood pressure 148/74,
respiratory 24, 99% on room air.  In general she was alert
and oriented times three.  Cardiac examination was irregular.
Chest examination with a fair amount of air entry.  Abdominal
examination, tenderness, guarding mainly in the right lower
quadrant.  Positive tympani.  Extremities were warm, no edema
or erythema.  Rectal examination, guaiac negative.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data on admission revealed white
count 13.7, hematocrit 42, platelets 397, sodium 139,
potassium 4.1, chloride 97, bicarbonate 34, BUN 19,
creatinine 1.0, glucose 127.  Liver function tests, ALT 16,
AST 28, alkaline phosphatase 78, total bilirubin 0.5, amylase
43.  Urinalysis, trace leukocytes, small blood, trace
ketones, red blood cells [**3-30**] and white blood cells [**3-30**].
Chest x-ray showed free air in his diaphragm on the right.
Abdominal x-rays, upright film showed free air with air in
the colon.  Stool absent all the way down through the colon.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted and placed on
Ampicillin, Levofloxacin, and Flagyl.  Blood cultures were
sent.  On hospital day #1, [**2833-9-30**], the patient
underwent partial gastrectomy and gastrojejunostomy with
placement of feeding J-tube for a perforated gastric ulcer.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no
complications during the surgery.  The patient was placed in
the Intensive Care Unit over night, intubated.  On [**2833-10-1**], postoperative day #1, the patient was weaned from
ventilator support and extubated without difficulty.  The
patient's renal function improved to producing over 30 cc/hr
and soft bowel sounds were appreciated.  On postoperative day
#3 the patient was transferred to the floor.  On the floor,
the patient was started on half-strength tube feeds.  Total
parenteral nutrition was continued and by [**10-6**],
postoperative day #6 the patient was tolerating sips.  On the
day of [**10-5**], the patient had one episode of atrial
fibrillation that was successfully controlled with
intravenous Lopressor.  By [**10-7**], the patient was
tolerating liquids without difficulty.  Total parenteral
nutrition had been stopped, antibiotics had been stopped and
rehabilitation planning had started.  Tube feeds were
increased to almost goal.  On [**10-8**], the patient was
tolerating full liquids without difficulty and was discharged

                                     FINAL REPORT *ABNORMAL!
     INDICATION: Right lower quadrant abdominal pain and free air seen on
     radiograph.
     
     COMPARISON: Radiograph, earlier, same day.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images through the abdomen and pelvis were
     obtained following the administration of oral contrast. Coronal reformats were
     obtained.
     
     IV CONTRAST: 150 cc Optiray due to patient debility.
     
     ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  There is dependent change at both lung bases.  Minimal
     pleural thickening is also noted posteriorly.  There are multiple small
     pockets of free gas, posterior and anterior to the liver as well as inferior
     to the liver.  Two small low density lesions are present within the right
     posterior aspect of the liver, the largest of these is a simple cyst by
     Hounsfield criteria, and the other may also be a simple cyst, but is too small
     to definitively characterize.  There are no other focal liver abnormalities.
     The gallbladder is located very laterally and posteriorly but otherwise
     appears unremarkable.  The spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands and kidneys are
     unremarkable.  Within the fundus of the stomach, there is a marked wall
     thickening, with a more mass-like component measuring 2.4 cm in thickness
     posteriorly.  Additionally, just inferior to the stomach, there is a
     collection of contrast measuring 2.4 x 4.7 cm which is external to the GI
     tract.  A moderate amount of inflammatory reaction is present surrounding this
     collection.  The remainder of the bowel loops are unremarkable in caliber and
     appearance.
     
     PELVIC WITH CONTRAST:  A Foley catheter is present within the bladder.  Pelvic
     loops of bowel are unremarkable.  There is no inguinal or pelvic
     lymphadenopathy.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  Dense calcification is noted within the aorta.  There are no
     suspicious lytic or sclerotic bony lesions.  Calcification within the soft
                                                                 (Over)

     IMPRESSION:
     1) Findings are consistent with a gastric perforation; differential diagnosis
     includes perforated ulcer, lymphoma, or carcinoma.  Findings reviewed with the
     surgery team at the time of the study.

     pulmonary embolism.  There are dense bibasilar consolidations effecting almost
     the entirety of both lower lobes with air bronchograms.  The upper lobes are
     notable for  subtle patchy opacification. There are no pleural effusions.  A
     few prominent precarinal lymph nodes are noted. The airways are patent through
     the segmental levels bilaterally. There are air fluid levels in the
     esophagus. There is limited visualization of the organs of the upper abdomen.
     Superior- most liver, spleen and stomach are unremarkable. There are no
     suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1.  Consolidations at both lung bases consistent with
     bibasilar pneumonia and less likely atelectasis involving both lower lobes
     with sparing only of their more superior aspects. Subtle patchy
     opacifications in the upper lobes and air-fluid levels in the esphagus suggest
     gastroesphageal reflux and therefore aspriation must be considered a likely
     etiology.
     
     2. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.

     INDICATIONS:  [**Age over 90 **] y/o woman with dyspnea and hypoxia, pneumonia or CHF. 
     
     PORTABLE AP CHEST:  Comparison is made to previous films from yesterday.
     
     There is slight increase in mild congestive heart failure with mild pleural
     effusion. There is increase in bibasilar patchy opacities indicating
     atelectasis.  The possibility of pneumonia cannot be excluded.
     
     The heart is normal in size. Again noted is made of tortuosity of the thoracic
     aorta with extensive calcification.  Again note is made of healed fracture in
     the right distal clavicle.
     
     IMPRESSION:   Essentially worsened mild CHF with bilateral small pleural
     effusions. Increased bibasilar opacities, atelectasis versus pneumonia.

      [**Age over 90 **] yo woman with history esophageal dysmotility and s/p recent gastrectomy for

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: Bilateral lower lobe pneumonia with history of esophageal
     dysmotility. Assess for aspiration.
     
     FINDINGS: The patient was fed a variety of liquids and solids labeled with
     barium. No aspiration or penetration was identified. There was, however,
     pooling of secretions within the piriform sinuses, valleculae, and in the
     region of the upper esophageal sphincter, which is slow to open. The esophagus
     appears generally dilated. Reflux was appreciated during the study. Solids in
     particular were difficult for the patient to clear, requiring thin liquid to
     wash the solids down.
     
     IMPRESSION: No aspiration identified. Dilated esophagus with delayed upper
     esophageal sphincter opening. Reflux.

     COMMENTS:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest are reviewed and compared
     to the previous study of [**2833-12-18**].
     
     The previously identified consolidation in both lower lobes have been markedly
     improving.  There is contrast seen within the distal esophagus.  The pleura is
     identified, pulmonary edema has been also improving.  The heart is normal in
     size.  Again, note is made of previous fracture in the right distal clavicle.
