Admission Date:  [**3401-6-5**]     Discharge Date:  [**3401-6-10**]

Date of Birth:   [**3310-2-24**]     Sex:  M

Service: Neurosurgery
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old
male with asymptomatic left carotid stenosis.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   The patient has a past medical
history of type 2 diabetes times 30 years, hypertension,

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  A past surgical history of an
appendectomy and bilateral cataract surgery.

ALLERGIES:  He has no known allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On physical
general, he was in good health and in no acute distress.  His
head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination showed there
were no palpable nodes.  He had bilateral carotid bruits.
Cranial nerve examination was intact.  His chest was clear to
auscultation.  His cardiovascular examination revealed a
regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs or gallops.  His
abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.  No masses or
bruits.  His lower extremities revealed he had trace pedal
edema, positive pedal pulses, and his strength was intact
except for some mild right lower extremity weakness.  His
gait was normal.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted for attempted
carotid stenting which was unsuccessful because of a calcified
and highly tortuous aortic arch which prevented successful
catheterization. The patient tolerated the procedure well.  His
pulses were intact.  His groin site was clean, dry, and intact.
He was started back up on his Coumadin; currently, at 4 mg p.o.
q.d.  His INR was 2.1.  He was to have his INR checked after
discharge on [**3401-6-11**].  He was to follow up with his primary
care doctor, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10730**], next week.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  Other medications at the time of
discharge included atorvastatin 20 mg p.o. q.d.

DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:  The patient was to follow up with his
primary care doctor.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  He was in stable condition at the
time of discharge.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      [**Age over 90 **] year old man with carotid stenosis.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      [**Age over 90 **] year old male with carotid stenosis. Plan is for a diagnostic cerebral
      angiogram and carotid stent angioplasty.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
     PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Rule out left internal carotid artery stenosis,
     status post left hemispheric stroke approximately 6 years ago.
     
     POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Critical stenosis greater than 90% of the left
     internal carotid status post attempted microcatheterization for anticipation
     of angioplasty and stenting.
     
     INDICATION:  This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old man who 6 years ago suffered a stroke after
     taking a transatlantic flight to his native [**Country 9835**].  This was characterized by
     aphasia and weakness of his right side.  He has subsequently undergone follow
     up carotid ultrasounds which has revealed progression.  He has significant
     medical history including diabetes and coronary artery.
     
     CONSENT:  The patient and his family were given a full and complete
     explanation of the procedure including the risks, benefits and possible
     complications.  These include but are not limited to stroke, infection, death,
     vessel rupture, vessel injury, as well as other unforeseen complications. They
     understood and wished to proceed with the operation.
     
     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  The patient was brought into the endovascular suite and
     placed on the table in supine position.  The right and left groin areas were
     prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.
     
     ANESTHESIA:  Anesthesia was provided by members of the anesthesia department
     under monitored anesthesia care (MAC).
     
     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  A 5 FR vascular sheath was placed into the right common
     femoral artery. He was kept on a heparinized saline flush. A 5 FR Berenstein 2
     catheter was used to attempt to catheterize the right common carotid artery.
     This was, however, unsuccessful because of the tortuosity of the patient's
     aortic artery and its heavily calcified nature. To that end [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2272**] catheter
     was utilized and this allowed us to catheterize the right common carotid
     artery.  With the catheter in the right common carotid artery, series of
     biplane angiographic runs were obtained of the bifurcation as well as of the
     intracranial circulation.  The catheter was then used to place into the left
     common carotid artery.  With the catheter in the left common carotid artery, a
                                                                 (Over)

     series of biplane angiographic runs were obtained in both AP and lateral
     projections of the neck and head. At this point, examination of the studies
     revealed the presence of greater than 90% stenosis at the bifurcation on the
     left side. This was deemed to be significant enough to warrant an attempt at
     endovascular treatment. To that end, a  300 cm exchange wire was used through
     the [**Doctor Last Name 2272**] catheter and placed in the left external carotid artery. The
     [**Doctor Last Name 2272**] catheter was then exchanged successfully.  This was performed after
     increasing the vascular sheath size to an 8 FR and with the exchange wire in
     the left external carotid artery, an attempt was made to place the 8 FR guide
     catheter into the left common carotid artery.  However, repeated attempts were
     made and because of the heavily calcified native of the aortic arch and the
     tortuous origin, it was not possible for the guidewire to follow into the left
     common carotid artery.  After four attempts in addition to achieve significant
     purchase in the left external carotid artery with the wire to enable
     transition of the guide catheter, a decision was made to halt in order to
     avoid disturbing the plaque in the left internal carotid artery and cause an
     embolus.  To that and the guide catheter system and wire were removed and the
     patient appeared to have suffered no neurological sequela as a result of the
     procedure. The 8 FR vascular sheath was withdrawn over a wire and a perclose
     device was used to perform the closure of the arteriotomy site.  This
     procedure was done while the patient was heparinized.  Of note, he received
     5,000 units of bolus of heparin at the beginning of the procedure after
     obtaining femoral access and his preoperative ACT at baseline increased from
     138 to 300.  He received an additional 2,500 units of heparin 1 hour later.
     After removal and closure of the arteriotomy site, the patient was transferred
     to the recovery room in excellent neurologic condition having suffered no
     neurological sequelae and was maintained on heparin.
     
     RESULTS:  Injection of the right common carotid artery reveals the presence of
     a smooth 20% plaque at the origin of the right internal carotid artery with no
     significant hemodynamic compromise.  The injection of the right common carotid
     artery reveals the right external carotid artery to [**Hospital1 4289**] no evidence of
     arteriovenous shunting.  The supraclinoid segment of the right internal
     carotid artery is smooth, however, the distal cavernous segment appears to
     have two focal regions of minimal stenosis with no significance
     hemodynamically.  Intracranially, the internal carotid artery is seen to
     provide flow to both anterior cerebral arteries via a patent anterior
     communicating artery.  There is no evidence of intracranial aneurysm or
     arteriovenous malformation from the right-sided injection.  Injection of the
     left common carotid artery reveals a 2 cm long segment of severe stenosis
     ranging to a peak of greater than 90%.  There is no evidence of stenosis at
     the origin of the left external carotid artery.  Intracranially, the left
     internal carotid artery supplies the middle cerebral artery territory and the
     anterior cerebral artery A1 segment is not visualized from this injection.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Severe greater than 90% left internal carotid artery stenosis at
                                                                 (Over)
