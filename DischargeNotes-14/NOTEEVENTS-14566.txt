                                     FINAL REPORT
     
     The aortoiliac bifemoral arteriogram was performed because of ischemic changes
     in the left leg and a decrease in the flow through the fem-[**Hospital Unit Name **] graft.  In
     addition to ischemic changes on the right.
     
     Informed consent was obtained.  The patient was placed on the angiography
     table and the right groin prepped and draped in a sterile manner.  A needle
     followed by guidewire and catheter were passed from the femoral artery into
     the aorta.  An injection at the celiac level reveal patency of all of the
     visceral vessels in addition to the previously placed aorto-bifemoral graft.
     The flow on the right is significantly great than the left.  There are
     dilations bilaterally at the insertion of each femoral artery of the graft.
     
     The catheter was moved inferiorly and the left limb of the aorto-bifemoral
     graft was catheterized by passing the catheter over the bifurcation. Injection
     of contrast material reveals occlusion of the profunda femoral artery.  The
     origin of the venous bypass is patent with no evidence of a significant
     narrowing, however, in the proximal thigh  area there are two significant
     areas of narrowing one in the mid femoral and one in the above knee popliteal
     area. The insertion of the graft is in the below knee popliteal artery which
     is unremarkable and there is good runoff through the anterior tibial and
     posterior  tibial arteries, however, the posterior tibial artery is small in
     caliber with poor  runoff below the heel.  The anterior tibial fills the
     dorsalis pedis.
     
     The catheter was then withdrawn over the bifurcation into the right limb of
     the aorto-bifemoral graft with runoff of the right leg showing a venous bypass
     extending to the below knee tibioperoneal trunk.  The right profunda femoral
     artery is patent.  The anterior tibial artery is patent at its origin although
     mildly narrowed just distally and the runoff vessels are small in caliber,
     however, there is good filling of a dorsalis pedis as well as posterior tibial
     and plantar vessels.
     
     CONCLUSION:
     
     1.  Two segmental arteries of significant stenosis in the left femoral below
     knee popliteal graft.  The origin and insertion of the graft are excellent.
     There is runoff on the right with no evidence of significant narrowing,
                                                                 (Over)

     HISTORY: Carotid bruits.
     
     FINDINGS: There is heterogeneous calcified plaque involving the internal and
     external carotid arteries bilaterally. The peak systolic velocities on the
     right are 126, 80 and 245 cm per second for the ICA, CCA and ECA respectively.
     The ICA to CCA ratio is 1.5. Findings indicate a 40-59% right ICA stenosis.
     
     On the left, the peak systolic velocities are 111, 80 and 178 cm per second
     for the ICA, CCA, and ECA respectively. The ICA to CCA ratio is 1.3. Findings
     also indicate a 40-59% left ICA stenosis. There is antegrade flow in the right
     vertebral artery, the left vertebral artery was not visualized, presumed
     hypoplastic or occluded.
     
     IMPRESSION: Bilateral heterogeneous calcified plaque with associated bilateral
     40-59% ICA stenoses. Stenosis involving the external carotid arteries are of
     higher grade and may account for the bruits heard on physical exam.

     PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Ischemic left lower extremity, status post multiple
     lower extremity bypass grafts.
     
     POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Same with occluded left limb of previous aorto-
     bifemoral bypass graft, occluded left common femoral artery to profunda artery
     bypass graft, occluded left common femoral artery to above knee popliteal
     artery bypass graft.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Abdominal and pelvic aortogram.  Initiation of thrombolysis in the
     left limb of the aorto-bifemoral bypass graft.
     
     ANESTHESIA:  Local with sedation including 500 mg of Fentanyl IV, 8 mg of
     Versed IV, 10 cc of 1% Lidocaine subcutaneously.  55 cc of nonionic contrast
     was used.
     
     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  The patient was brought into the operating room and
     placed in a supine position.  Both groins were prepped and draped in the
     normal sterile manner.  Retrograde right femoral access was obtained using a
     19 gauge [**Last Name (LF) 10529**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 0.035 starter wire, and 5 FR sheath.  An Omniflush
     catheter in conjunction with an angled guidewire was able to be manipulated
     across the previous aorto-bifemoral bypass graft and placed into the abdominal
     aorta at the level of the mid body of L1 vertebral body.  An AP abdominal
     aortogram was obtained at this time.  The catheter was then brought down to
     the level of the bifurcation and a pelvic aortogram was obtained.  It was
     noted that the left limb of the previously placed aorto-bifemoral bypass graft
     was occluded. Using the Omniflush catheter in conjunction with an angled
     guidewire, we attempted to gain access to the occluded left limb of the
     previously placed aortobifemoral bypass graft.  We were able to advance the
     guidewire down to the level of the distal external iliac artery on the left.
     However, we were unable to get the Omniflush catheter to track over the wire.
     As a result of the aortobifemoral bypass graft, there was an extremely tight
     angle at the bifurcation.  We attempted to place a 6 FR [**Last Name (un) 10530**] sheath over the
     bifurcation unsuccessfully. Then using a SOS catheter, again we tried to
                                                                 (Over)

     advance the catheter over the wire unsuccessfully. This was once again
     attempted with an angled guide catheter unsuccessfully. The long 6 FR [**Last Name (un) 10530**]
     sheath was changed over for a short 6 FR sheath in the right groin. At this
     time, we were able to advance the angled guide catheter over the angled
     guidewire into the proximal one- third of the occluded left limb of the aorto-
     bifemoral bypass graft. Pulse spray TPA was given to a total of 1 mg of TPA in
     that limb over a period of ten minutes. The entire process was repeated using
     the SOS catheter, the Omniflush catheter and the angled guide catheter.
     However, we were still unable to completely access that limb of the bypass
     graft.  At this time, using a micropuncture set and a 4 FR sheath, retrograde
     left femoral access was obtained and the 4 FR sheath was changed over a
     starter wire to a 5 FR sheath. From the retrograde left femoral access, the
     angled guidewire and an angled guide catheter were easily advanced into the
     abdominal aorta from this approach.  Over the angled guidewire, a 100 cm
     [**Location (un) 10531**]-[**Last Name (un) 10532**] infusion catheter with a 20 cm infusion length was placed into
     the left limb of the aorto- bifemoral bypass graft.  Both sheaths were sutured
     to the groin using interrupted 3-0 silk sutures.  The [**Location (un) 10531**]-[**Last Name (un) 10532**] infusion
     catheter was sutured as well using a 3-0 silk suture in a sterile manner.  We
     began infusing 500 units per hour of heparin through the side arm of the
     sheath on the right.  A pressure bag was attached to the sheath on the left
     and a TPA infusion of 1 mg per hour was used as an infusion through the [**Location (un) 10531**]-
     [**Last Name (un) 10532**] infusion catheter. There were no complications, and the patient was
     taken to the intensive care unit for thrombolytic therapy overnight and
     monitoring after sterile dressings were placed.
     
     ANGIOGRAPHIC INTERPRETATION: There are single renal arteries bilaterally
     without evidence of significant stenoses at their origins.  There is a
     previously placed aorto- bifemoral bypass graft in place with an occluded left
     limb of this aorto- bifemoral bypass graft.  The right limb of the bypass
     graft is patent and somewhat patulous at its distal anastomosis to the common
     femoral artery. There is no visualization of the left limb of the bypass graft
     and indeed no distal collateral circulation to the common femoral artery on
     the left side.

     PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Ischemic left lower extremity, status post multiple
     lower extremity bypass grafts.
     
     POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Same with occluded left limb of previous aorto-
     bifemoral bypass graft, occluded left common femoral artery to profunda artery
     bypass graft, occluded left common femoral artery to above knee popliteal
     artery bypass graft.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Abdominal and pelvic aortogram.  Initiation of thrombolysis in the
     left limb of the aorto-bifemoral bypass graft.
     
     ANESTHESIA:  Local with sedation including 500 mg of Fentanyl IV, 8 mg of
     Versed IV, 10 cc of 1% Lidocaine subcutaneously.  55 cc of nonionic contrast
     was used.
     
     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  The patient was brought into the operating room and
     placed in a supine position.  Both groins were prepped and draped in the
     normal sterile manner.  Retrograde right femoral access was obtained using a
     19 gauge [**Last Name (LF) 10529**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 0.035 starter wire, and 5 FR sheath.  An Omniflush
     catheter in conjunction with an angled guidewire was able to be manipulated
     across the previous aorto-bifemoral bypass graft and placed into the abdominal
     aorta at the level of the mid body of L1 vertebral body.  An AP abdominal
     aortogram was obtained at this time.  The catheter was then brought down to
     the level of the bifurcation and a pelvic aortogram was obtained.  It was
     noted that the left limb of the previously placed aorto-bifemoral bypass graft
     was occluded. Using the Omniflush catheter in conjunction with an angled
     guidewire, we attempted to gain access to the occluded left limb of the
     previously placed aortobifemoral bypass graft.  We were able to advance the
     guidewire down to the level of the distal external iliac artery on the left.
     However, we were unable to get the Omniflush catheter to track over the wire.
     As a result of the aortobifemoral bypass graft, there was an extremely tight
     angle at the bifurcation.  We attempted to place a 6 FR [**Last Name (un) 10530**] sheath over the
     bifurcation unsuccessfully. Then using a SOS catheter, again we tried to

     attempted with an angled guide catheter unsuccessfully. The long 6 FR [**Last Name (un) 10530**]
     sheath was changed over for a short 6 FR sheath in the right groin. At this
     time, we were able to advance the angled guide catheter over the angled
     guidewire into the proximal one- third of the occluded left limb of the aorto-
     bifemoral bypass graft. Pulse spray TPA was given to a total of 1 mg of TPA in
     that limb over a period of ten minutes. The entire process was repeated using
     the SOS catheter, the Omniflush catheter and the angled guide catheter.
     However, we were still unable to completely access that limb of the bypass
     graft.  At this time, using a micropuncture set and a 4 FR sheath, retrograde
     left femoral access was obtained and the 4 FR sheath was changed over a
     starter wire to a 5 FR sheath. From the retrograde left femoral access, the
     angled guidewire and an angled guide catheter were easily advanced into the
     abdominal aorta from this approach.  Over the angled guidewire, a 100 cm
     [**Location (un) 10531**]-[**Last Name (un) 10532**] infusion catheter with a 20 cm infusion length was placed into
     the left limb of the aorto- bifemoral bypass graft.  Both sheaths were sutured

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:

     SURGEON:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1441**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7035**].  Assistant:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 10528**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 997**].
     
     PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Ischemic left lower extremity, status post multiple
     lower extremity bypass grafts.
     
     POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Same with occluded left limb of previous aorto-
     bifemoral bypass graft, occluded left common femoral artery to profunda artery
     bypass graft, occluded left common femoral artery to above knee popliteal
     artery bypass graft.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Abdominal and pelvic aortogram.  Initiation of thrombolysis in the
     left limb of the aorto-bifemoral bypass graft.
     
     ANESTHESIA:  Local with sedation including 500 mg of Fentanyl IV, 8 mg of
     Versed IV, 10 cc of 1% Lidocaine subcutaneously.  55 cc of nonionic contrast
     was used.
     
     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  The patient was brought into the operating room and
     placed in a supine position.  Both groins were prepped and draped in the
     normal sterile manner.  Retrograde right femoral access was obtained using a
     19 gauge [**Last Name (LF) 10529**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 0.035 starter wire, and 5 FR sheath.  An Omniflush
     catheter in conjunction with an angled guidewire was able to be manipulated
     across the previous aorto-bifemoral bypass graft and placed into the abdominal
     aorta at the level of the mid body of L1 vertebral body.  An AP abdominal
     aortogram was obtained at this time.  The catheter was then brought down to
     the level of the bifurcation and a pelvic aortogram was obtained.  It was
     noted that the left limb of the previously placed aorto-bifemoral bypass graft
     was occluded. Using the Omniflush catheter in conjunction with an angled
     guidewire, we attempted to gain access to the occluded left limb of the
     previously placed aortobifemoral bypass graft.  We were able to advance the
     guidewire down to the level of the distal external iliac artery on the left.
     However, we were unable to get the Omniflush catheter to track over the wire.
     As a result of the aortobifemoral bypass graft, there was an extremely tight
     angle at the bifurcation.  We attempted to place a 6 FR [**Last Name (un) 10530**] sheath over the
     bifurcation unsuccessfully. Then using a SOS catheter, again we tried to
                                                                 (Over)

     advance the catheter over the wire unsuccessfully. This was once again
     attempted with an angled guide catheter unsuccessfully. The long 6 FR [**Last Name (un) 10530**]
     sheath was changed over for a short 6 FR sheath in the right groin. At this
     time, we were able to advance the angled guide catheter over the angled
     guidewire into the proximal one- third of the occluded left limb of the aorto-
     bifemoral bypass graft. Pulse spray TPA was given to a total of 1 mg of TPA in
     that limb over a period of ten minutes. The entire process was repeated using
     the SOS catheter, the Omniflush catheter and the angled guide catheter.
     However, we were still unable to completely access that limb of the bypass
     graft.  At this time, using a micropuncture set and a 4 FR sheath, retrograde
     left femoral access was obtained and the 4 FR sheath was changed over a
     starter wire to a 5 FR sheath. From the retrograde left femoral access, the
     angled guidewire and an angled guide catheter were easily advanced into the
     abdominal aorta from this approach.  Over the angled guidewire, a 100 cm
     [**Location (un) 10531**]-[**Last Name (un) 10532**] infusion catheter with a 20 cm infusion length was placed into
     the left limb of the aorto- bifemoral bypass graft.  Both sheaths were sutured
     to the groin using interrupted 3-0 silk sutures.  The [**Location (un) 10531**]-[**Last Name (un) 10532**] infusion
     catheter was sutured as well using a 3-0 silk suture in a sterile manner.  We
     began infusing 500 units per hour of heparin through the side arm of the
     sheath on the right.  A pressure bag was attached to the sheath on the left
     and a TPA infusion of 1 mg per hour was used as an infusion through the [**Location (un) 10531**]-
     [**Last Name (un) 10532**] infusion catheter. There were no complications, and the patient was
     taken to the intensive care unit for thrombolytic therapy overnight and
     monitoring after sterile dressings were placed.
     
     ANGIOGRAPHIC INTERPRETATION: There are single renal arteries bilaterally
     without evidence of significant stenoses at their origins.  There is a
     previously placed aorto- bifemoral bypass graft in place with an occluded left
     limb of this aorto- bifemoral bypass graft.  The right limb of the bypass
     graft is patent and somewhat patulous at its distal anastomosis to the common
     femoral artery. There is no visualization of the left limb of the bypass graft
     and indeed no distal collateral circulation to the common femoral artery on
     the left side.

     INDICATION:  Left lower extremity ischemia, status post multiple bypass
     grafts.
     
     POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Left lower extremity ischemia, occluded left limb of
     previously placed aorto-bifemoral bypass graft, occluded left common femoral
     artery to above knee popliteal artery bypass graft, occluded left common
     femoral to profunda artery bypass graft.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Abdominal aortogram, selective cannulation of previous bypass
     graft on the left, left lower extremity arteriogram status post
     thrombolytic therapy.
     
     ANESTHESIA:  Local with sedation including 2 cc of 1% Lidocaine plain
     subcutaneously, 350 mg of Fentanyl IV, and 7 mg of Versed IV.
     
     OPERATIVE INDICATIONS:  This is a 48 year old gentleman with severe peripheral
     vascular disease and a history of massive tobacco in-take who presents with an
     acute approximately 4 day occlusion of three of his bypass grafts.  He
     presented for with an acutely ischemic left lower extremity and thrombolytic
     therapy was begun. He presents today for lytic check, after receiving TPA
     overnight.
     
     OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  The patient was brought into the interventional suite
     and placed in the supine position.  Skin of both groins is prepped and draped
     in a normal sterile fashion.  The previous lytic catheter on the left was
     removed.  Using an Omniflush catheter over an angled guidewire, access through
     the previously placed 6 FR sheath in the right groin was obtained.  The
     Omniflush catheter was placed to the appropriate level of L3 in the abdominal
     aorta and an aortogram was obtained.  Aortogram showed that the previous
     aorto-bifemoral bypass graft which had been occluded was opened with adequate
     flow.  At this time using the Omniflush catheter in conjunction with an angled
     guidewire, access was obtained to that left limb of the aorto-bifemoral bypass
     graft.  The catheter was taken down to the level of the previous anastomosis
     and another arteriogram was obtained.  This arteriogram demonstrated a very
     patulous distal anastomosis from the aorto-bifemoral bypass graft and flow
     into the previously placed fem above knee popliteal bypass with distal
     stenosis. At this time using the angled guidewire in conjunction with the
     angled guide catheter, access was obtained to that bypass and an angiogram was
     obtained. The angiogram demonstrated no defects in the bypass graft. However,
     at mid thigh, there is an acute occlusion of the bypass graft. Attempt to
     cross this lesion with a wire was unsuccessful.  At this time lytic therapy
     was terminated and all the wires and catheters were removed.  The 5 FR sheath
                                                                 (Over)

     and was taken to the operating room in stable condition.
     
     ANGIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS:  On the abdominal aortogram, there is a previously
     placed aorto-bifemoral bypass graft.  There is flow within both of the limbs
     of the bypass graft.  However, the flow on the left is much delayed compared
     to the flow on the right likely secondary to the outflow.  The left limb of
     the bypass graft is patent down to the common femoral artery where there is a
     patulous distal anastomosis.  There is now a patent bypass graft which
     resembles a Dacron bypass graft without evidence of defects in its proximal
     two-thirds.  However, mid thigh, there is an acute occlusion of this bypass
     graft and no flow distally.  There is no visualization of the profunda femoris
     artery and there is no visualization of the hypogastric artery.

                                     FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
     INDICATION:  Left lower extremity ischemia, status post multiple bypass
     grafts.
     
     POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Left lower extremity ischemia, occluded left limb of
     previously placed aorto-bifemoral bypass graft, occluded left common femoral
     artery to above knee popliteal artery bypass graft, occluded left common
     femoral to profunda artery bypass graft.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Abdominal aortogram, selective cannulation of previous bypass
     graft on the left, left lower extremity arteriogram status post
     thrombolytic therapy.
     
     ANESTHESIA:  Local with sedation including 2 cc of 1% Lidocaine plain
     subcutaneously, 350 mg of Fentanyl IV, and 7 mg of Versed IV.
     
     OPERATIVE INDICATIONS:  This is a 48 year old gentleman with severe peripheral
     vascular disease and a history of massive tobacco in-take who presents with an
     acute approximately 4 day occlusion of three of his bypass grafts.  He
     presented for with an acutely ischemic left lower extremity and thrombolytic
     therapy was begun. He presents today for lytic check, after receiving TPA
     overnight.
     
     OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  The patient was brought into the interventional suite
     and placed in the supine position.  Skin of both groins is prepped and draped
     in a normal sterile fashion.  The previous lytic catheter on the left was
     removed.  Using an Omniflush catheter over an angled guidewire, access through
     the previously placed 6 FR sheath in the right groin was obtained.  The
     Omniflush catheter was placed to the appropriate level of L3 in the abdominal
     aorta and an aortogram was obtained.  Aortogram showed that the previous
     aorto-bifemoral bypass graft which had been occluded was opened with adequate
     flow.  At this time using the Omniflush catheter in conjunction with an angled
     guidewire, access was obtained to that left limb of the aorto-bifemoral bypass
     graft.  The catheter was taken down to the level of the previous anastomosis
     and another arteriogram was obtained.  This arteriogram demonstrated a very
     patulous distal anastomosis from the aorto-bifemoral bypass graft and flow
     into the previously placed fem above knee popliteal bypass with distal
     stenosis. At this time using the angled guidewire in conjunction with the
     angled guide catheter, access was obtained to that bypass and an angiogram was
     obtained. The angiogram demonstrated no defects in the bypass graft. However,
     at mid thigh, there is an acute occlusion of the bypass graft. Attempt to
     cross this lesion with a wire was unsuccessful.  At this time lytic therapy
     was terminated and all the wires and catheters were removed.  The 5 FR sheath
                                                                 (Over)

     vein as demonstrated by elevated velocities of the distal anastomosis by
     duplex examination, status post revision of left femoral to above knee
     prosthetic graft to with a jump graft to the below knee popliteal artery with
     PTFE.
     
     POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Same.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Abdominal aortogram with bilateral lower extremity run-off.
     
     SURGEON:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1441**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7035**].  ASSISTANT:  [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 7194**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7195**].
     
     ANESTHESIA:  5 cc of 1% Lidocaine plain.
     
     PROCEDURE AND DETAIL:  Patient was brought into the interventional suite and
     placed in the supine position.  He was prepped and draped in a normal sterile
     manner.  Retrograde right femoral access was obtained using a 19 gauge needle,
     and 0.035 starter wire and a 5 FR sheath.  A straight multi-side-hole flush
     catheter was advanced over the wire into the infrarenal aorta and an AP
     aortogram was obtained at this time.  At this time, the catheter was brought
     back down into the aortic bifurcation and runoff views of the right and left
     lower extremity were obtained down to the level of the below knee popliteal
     space.  At this time, the catheter was pulled back into the right limb of the
     aortobifemoral bypass graft and again runoff views including a 30 degree [**Doctor Last Name **]
     and a 30 degree LAO view of the right groin were obtained to demonstrate the
     origin of the bypass graft.  The runoff was completed down to the level of the
     foot in the right extremity.  At this time, all sheaths, catheters, and wires
     were removed and access site was sealed with direct pressure.  The patient was
     taken to the postoperative anesthesia recovery unit in stable condition.  Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 7035**] was present for the entire procedure and fluoroscopy was utilized.
     
     ANGIOGRAPHIC DETAILS:  On AP aortogram, there is a patent celiac axis as well
     as a patent superior mesenteric artery.  The origins of both of these are not
     well visualized on the AP film.  There are bilateral single renal arteries
     without evidence of origin stenosis.  There are bilateral nephrograms without
     evidence of infarctions.  Approximately 3 cm distal to the renal arteries,
     there is a previously placed aortobifemoral bypass graft.  Both limbs of this
     is patent and there are no filling defects in either one.  Both of the
     hypogastrics were sacrificed and not seen on those images.  The distal
                                                                 (Over)

     (Cont)
     anastomoses are extremely patulous.  The left lower extremity demonstrates no
     evidence of profunda femoris artery, however, there is a bypass graft coming
     off the distal anastomosis of the aortobifemoral bypass graft.  There is again
     no profunda femoris noted there.  The bypass graft extends to the mid thigh
     where there is another anastomosis which then extends down to the below knee
     popliteal position.  There is retrograde filling of the native below and above
     knee popliteal artery.  There is also a stump of a previous bypass graft that
     fills just above the site where this new bypass graft enters the below knee
     popliteal artery.  The runoff distal to the anastomosis on the left side
     includes an anterior tibial artery with a mild stenosis at its origin as well
     as the tibioperoneal trunk that is patent and flows into a posterior tibial
     and peroneal artery.
     
     On right lower extremity examination, there is an extremely patulous distal
     anastomosis of the aortobifemoral bypass graft.  There is a profunda femoris
     with numerous branches and no evidence of origin stenosis.  Numerous obliques
     were obtained to adequately visualize the origin of the bypass graft which
     comes directly off the distal [**Doctor Last Name **] of the aortobifemoral bypass graft.  Of
     note, there is approximately 50% focal stenosis just distal to the proximal
     anastomosis.  As [**Doctor First Name 1041**] follow this bypass graft down, there are several
     approximately 3 cm regions of sclerosis in this arm vein bypass graft.  As the
     graft reaches the knee, there is no evidence of any sclerotic segment.  At
     approximately 1 cm prior to the distal anastomosis, there is a focal
     approximately 90% stenosis of the vein graft.  The distal anastomosis appears
     intact and there is retrograde filling of the native popliteal artery.  There
     is a patent anterior tibial as well as a tibioperoneal trunk.  There is a
     patent but very diminutive posterior tibial artery in the calf.  These vessels
     all extend down to the level of the ankle.  At the level of the foot, there is
     a dorsalis pedis which is in continuity with the anterior tibial artery as
     well as a posterior tibial artery which combine to form a complete plantar
     arch.

     PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Failing right fem to below knee bypass graft with arm
     vein as demonstrated by elevated velocities of the distal anastomosis by
     duplex examination, status post revision of left femoral to above knee
     prosthetic graft to with a jump graft to the below knee popliteal artery with
     PTFE.
     
     POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Same.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Abdominal aortogram with bilateral lower extremity run-off.
     
     SURGEON:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1441**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7035**].  ASSISTANT:  [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 7194**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7195**].
     
     ANESTHESIA:  5 cc of 1% Lidocaine plain.
     
     PROCEDURE AND DETAIL:  Patient was brought into the interventional suite and
     placed in the supine position.  He was prepped and draped in a normal sterile
     manner.  Retrograde right femoral access was obtained using a 19 gauge needle,
     and 0.035 starter wire and a 5 FR sheath.  A straight multi-side-hole flush
     catheter was advanced over the wire into the infrarenal aorta and an AP
     aortogram was obtained at this time.  At this time, the catheter was brought
     back down into the aortic bifurcation and runoff views of the right and left
     lower extremity were obtained down to the level of the below knee popliteal
     space.  At this time, the catheter was pulled back into the right limb of the
     aortobifemoral bypass graft and again runoff views including a 30 degree [**Doctor Last Name **]
     and a 30 degree LAO view of the right groin were obtained to demonstrate the
     origin of the bypass graft.  The runoff was completed down to the level of the
     foot in the right extremity.  At this time, all sheaths, catheters, and wires
     were removed and access site was sealed with direct pressure.  The patient was
     taken to the postoperative anesthesia recovery unit in stable condition.  Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 7035**] was present for the entire procedure and fluoroscopy was utilized.
     
     ANGIOGRAPHIC DETAILS:  On AP aortogram, there is a patent celiac axis as well
     as a patent superior mesenteric artery.  The origins of both of these are not
     well visualized on the AP film.  There are bilateral single renal arteries
     without evidence of origin stenosis.  There are bilateral nephrograms without
     evidence of infarctions.  Approximately 3 cm distal to the renal arteries,
     there is a previously placed aortobifemoral bypass graft.  Both limbs of this
     is patent and there are no filling defects in either one.  Both of the
     hypogastrics were sacrificed and not seen on those images.  The distal
                                                                 (Over)

     anastomoses are extremely patulous.  The left lower extremity demonstrates no
     evidence of profunda femoris artery, however, there is a bypass graft coming
     off the distal anastomosis of the aortobifemoral bypass graft.  There is again
     no profunda femoris noted there.  The bypass graft extends to the mid thigh
     where there is another anastomosis which then extends down to the below knee
     popliteal position.  There is retrograde filling of the native below and above
     knee popliteal artery.  There is also a stump of a previous bypass graft that
     fills just above the site where this new bypass graft enters the below knee
     popliteal artery.  The runoff distal to the anastomosis on the left side
     includes an anterior tibial artery with a mild stenosis at its origin as well
     as the tibioperoneal trunk that is patent and flows into a posterior tibial
     and peroneal artery.
     
     On right lower extremity examination, there is an extremely patulous distal
     anastomosis of the aortobifemoral bypass graft.  There is a profunda femoris
     with numerous branches and no evidence of origin stenosis.  Numerous obliques
     were obtained to adequately visualize the origin of the bypass graft which
     comes directly off the distal [**Doctor Last Name **] of the aortobifemoral bypass graft.  Of
     note, there is approximately 50% focal stenosis just distal to the proximal
     anastomosis.  As [**Doctor First Name 1041**] follow this bypass graft down, there are several
     approximately 3 cm regions of sclerosis in this arm vein bypass graft.  As the
     graft reaches the knee, there is no evidence of any sclerotic segment.  At
     approximately 1 cm prior to the distal anastomosis, there is a focal
     approximately 90% stenosis of the vein graft.  The distal anastomosis appears
     intact and there is retrograde filling of the native popliteal artery.  There
     is a patent anterior tibial as well as a tibioperoneal trunk.  There is a
     patent but very diminutive posterior tibial artery in the calf.  These vessels
     all extend down to the level of the ankle.  At the level of the foot, there is
     a dorsalis pedis which is in continuity with the anterior tibial artery as
     well as a posterior tibial artery which combine to form a complete plantar
     arch.

     graft there is increase in velocity to 250 cm/sec. This gives a PVR of 5 which
     is consistent with a >75% stenosis. In the midgraft there is an increase in
     velocity from 67 to 182 giving a PVR of approximately 3. This is consistent
     with approximately 50% stenosis at this location. Throughout the remainder of
     the graft velocities range from 38 through 81.
     
     IMPRESSION: Patent right femoral-popliteal bypass graft with possible proximal
     pseudoaneurysm. In addition there are two locations within the proximal graft
     one which appears to be >75% stenosis and another which is approximately 50%
     stenosis.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: Graft surveillance in a 48 year old man with severe peripheral
     vascular disease, status post right femoral-popliteal bypass and status post
     left double bypass connecting (1) the common and superficial femoral arteries
     and (2) the superfical femoral artery with the left tibial artery.
     
     TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS: [**Doctor Last Name **] scale, color Doppler and spectral Doppler
     examinations were performed bilaterally at the level of the bypasses as well
     as the corresponding native arteries upstream and downstream.
     
     On the right, there is pseudoaneurysmal dilation at the proximal bypass
     anastomosis, measured at 2.2 x 1.4 cm. At that level, the peak systolic
     velocities (PSVs) are 40 cm/sec. Above that, in the native right common
     femoral artery, the PSVs are 29 cm/sec. Below that, the PSVs are 53 cm/sec in
     the upper portion of the bypass, then increased to 297 and even 401 cm/sec in
     the upper mid-thigh, and then dropped again to values between 43 and 61 cm/sec
     at the distal, above-knee thigh and 31 to 41 cm/sec below the knee. At the
     distal bypass anastomosis, the PSV is 24 cm/sec, and in the native vessel,
     distally to the bypass, the PSV is 39 cm/sec.
     
     On the left, the first bypass goes from the common femoral artery to the mid-
     lower superficial femoral artery. The second bypass goes from the same level
     in the superficial femoral artery and ends at the level of the below-knee
     proximal posterior tibial artery. The PSVs are 61 cm/sec in the native common
     femoral artery, 55 cm/sec at the proximal anastomosis of the first bypass, 45
     to 55 cm/sec within the first bypass itself, 59 cm/sec at the junction between
     both bypasses, 74 to 109 cm/sec in the second bypass, 129 cm/sec at the distal
     anastomosis of the lower bypass, and 69 cm/sec in the native left posterior
     tibial artery below the bypass.
     
     CONCLUSIONS:
     1.  Pseudoaneurysmal dilation at the proximal bypass anastomosis, 22 x 14 mm
     in diameter.
     2.  Significant focal stenosis in the right femoral-popliteal bypass, at the
     level of the upper thigh.
     3.  Patency of both bypasses in the left lower extremity.

     ANESTHESIA: Local with sedation including 7 cc of 1% Lidocaine plain
     subcutaneously, 4 mg of Versed IV, and 200 mg of Fentanyl IV.
     
     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: Patient was brought to the Neurointerventional suite and
     placed in supine position. Afte adequate sedation per Nursing he was prepped
     and draped in the normal sterile manner. Retrograde right common femoral
     artery access was obtained using a 19 gauge single wall puncture needle, a
     0.035 starter wire and a 4 Fr sheath. The wire was easily advanced into the
     infrarenal aorta and over this a straight multisidehole flush catheter was
     placed at the midbody of L1. An AP abdominal aortogram was taken at this time.
     The catheter was then moved back dowhn to the level of the bifurcation of the
     aortobifermoral bypass graft and a pelvic view was taken. The catheter was
     then brought back into the right limb of the aortobifemoral bypass graft and
     runoff views of the right lower extremity from the level of the groin to the
     level of the foot were completed. At this time all catheters, wires, and
     sheaths were removed and the access site was sealed with direct pressure. The
     patient was taken to the Postoperative Anesthesia Care unit in stable
     condition. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7035**] was present and scrubbed for the entire procedure and
     fluoroscopy was utilized.
     
     ANGIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS: On AP abdominal aortogram. The abdominal aorta is
     diffusely diseased. There is a patent celiac and superior mesenteric arteries
     although their origins are not well visualized. There is a single renal artery
     supplying the right kidney and two renal arteries which supply the left
     kidney. There are bilateral equal nephrograms and there are no origin stenoses
     of the renal arteries. Below the renals there is an aortobifemoral bypass

     graft. The right limb uncinate fills quite faster than the left limb. However
     both limbs are widely patent without evidence of narrowing. We see a quite
     patulous anastomosis in the right groin. It is anastomosis to the profunda
     femoris artery. The profunda femoris artery has no evidence of stenosis at its
     origin and has two widely patent branches with only mild disease. With the
     bypass graft and this was taken in several projections which fills
     considerably slower than the profunda branches there is a stenosis at the
     origin right at the proximal anastomosis which is approximately 80%.
     Approximately 7 cm distal to the proximal anastomosis there are three areas of
     greater than 99% stenosis. Beyond this region the bypass graft is otherwise
     patent. There is a patulous distal anastomosis which appears as if there was a
     previously placed vein patch. The anterior tibial artery is patent but is an
     extremely small vessel. It is patent throughout its length. The distal
     anatomosis is to the origin of the anterior tibial and tibioperoneal trunk.
     There is retrograde filling of the below-knee popliteal artery. The
     tibioperoneal trunk is diseased but patent. There is an origin stenosis at
     both the origin of the posterior tibial and at the origin of the peroneal
     artery. The anterior tibial, posterior tibial and peroneal arteries are patent
     throughout the calf. Runoff views of the foot demonstrate that there is a
     patent dorsalis pedis as well as a patent posterior tibial artery and a
     complete arch. This is seen on both lateral and AP projections.

     artery. The anterior tibial, posterior tibial and peroneal arteries are patent
     throughout the calf. Runoff views of the foot demonstrate that there is a
     patent dorsalis pedis as well as a patent posterior tibial artery and a
     complete arch. This is seen on both lateral and AP projections.
