History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known patient lastname 10397**] is a 70 year old female admitted to [**Hospital 276**] Hospital 
for chest pain. She ruled in for a myocardial infarction by 
enzymes with a troponin of 0.21. Her hospital course was 
complicataed by pulmonary edema on [**3501-1-23**] for which she was 
intubated. She was also found to be quite anemic requiring 6 
units of blood total. Ceftriaxone was started for pneumonia. A 
cardiac catheterization was significant for an 80% stenosed 
right coronary artery, mild circumflex disease and questionable 
left main disease. She was subsequently transferred to the [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] 
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2064**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for percutaneous coronary

[**3501-2-1**] EKG 
Atrial fibrillation. Left ventricular hypertrophy with ST-T wave 
changs. No
previous tracing available for comparison.  

[**3501-2-1**] Cardiac Catheterization
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system 
demonstrated significant disease in the LMCA. The short LMCA had 
an 
ostial and proximal 80% lesion which resulted in pressure 
damping using 
a 5 French catheter. The LAD had mild luminal irregularities 
without 
angiographically apparent, flow-limiting disease. The LCx had a 
60% 
lesion in the OM1 branch and mild disease in the OM2. The RCA 
was not 
selectively engaged but had a known 50% diffuse proximal segment 
and a 
focal 80% midvessel lesion. 

[**3501-2-4**] Carotid duplex ultrasound
Plaque formation seen at the bilateral carotid bifurcations, 
associated with a 60-69% stenosis in the right internal carotid 
artery and a less than 40% stenosis in the left internal carotid 
artery.

[**3501-2-4**] ECHO
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved 
global  
and regional biventricular systolic function. Mild pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. Mild mitral regurgitation.  

[**3501-2-5**] CXR
Cardiomegaly

[**3501-2-7**] Successful exchange of nonfunctioning right IJ 
hemodialysis catheter for a new 19-cm catheter-tip tunneled 
hemodialysis catheter with tip in right atrium. Line is ready 
for use.

[**3501-2-11**] Cardiac Catheterization
1. Severe native three vessel coronary artery disease. 
2. LIMA with 90% narrowing in the mid vessel consistent with a 
kink. 
3. Severely elevated right sided filling pressures. 
4. Moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension. 
5. Severely elevated left sided filling pressures. 
6. Successful placement of drug-eluting stents in RCA 

[**3501-2-14**] Head CT
Multiple foci of decreased attenuation involving both the [**Doctor Last Name 898**] 
and white matter in the parietooccipital regions bilaterally, 
which likely represent infarcts. Given the lack of a specific 
vascular distribution and the multiplicity of these, this likely 
is an embolic phenomenon. No intracranial hemorrhage.

[**3501-2-20**] PICC Placement

[**3501-2-26**] Abdomen CT scan
Extensive atheromatous disease involving the aorta as well as 
the visceral arteries. Probable hepatic and splenic infarcts. 
Probable colitis distal colon. Correlate clinically and with 
endoscopy if indicated. Discussed with Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] of referring 
team. There are patchy-ground glass changes within the entire 
lungs, which findings should be correlated with other parameters 
of failure. Airways appear patent. Incidental small tracheal 
diverticulum was seen.

[**3501-3-1**] Ultrasound
1) Normal Doppler evaluation of the portal veins, hepatic veins, 
and hepatic arteries. Given these findings and the subsegmental 
appearance of the hepatic infarct, an embolic etiology may be 
considered.
2) Ill-defined hypoechoic region in the right lobe/dome of the 
liver, corresponding to the area of suspected hepatic infarct.
3) Spleen not able to be imaged due to obscuring gas from the 
coexisting pneumothorax.

[**3501-3-4**] ECHO
1. The left atrium is normal in size. The right atrium is 
moderately dilated.  
2.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left 
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).  
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular 
systolic  
function is normal.  
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with 
good leaflet excursion.  
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.  
6.There is a small posterior ( to the right atrium) pericardial 
effusion.  
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat 
pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial effusion cannot be 
excluded.  
7. There is an echogenic density in the right ventricle 
consistent with a  
pacer wire.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known patient lastname 10397**] was admitted to the [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2064**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Medical 
Center on [**3501-2-1**] for further management of her cardiac disease. 
She underwent a cardiac catheterization which revealed left main 
and 2 vessel disease. After her cardiac catheterization she 
developed right lower quadrant pain. A CT scan was performed 
which revealed a moderate to large retroperitoneal bleed in her 
pelvis extending to the right kidney. As her vitals signs and 
hematocrit were stable, careful observation was performed. The 
renal staff was consulted for assistance with her end stage 
renal disease necessitating hemodialysis. Hemodialysis was 
resumed per her schedule. Given the severity of her coronary 
disease, the cardiac surgical service was consulted for surgical 
revascularization. Ms. [**Known patient lastname 10397**] was worked-up in the usual 
preoperative manner. She was transfused for anemia. Ceftriaxone 
and clindamycin were continued for pneumonia and an elevated 
white blood cell count. A carotid duplex ultrasound was 
performed which revealed moderate right and minimal left 
internal carotid artery stenosis. A dental consult was obtained 
which revealed several diseased teeth in need of extraction. On 
[**3501-2-8**], 4 teeth were successfully extracted without 
complication. On [**3501-2-11**], Ms. [**Known patient lastname 10397**] was taken to the operating 
room where she underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to 
three vessels. Postoperatively she was taken to the cardiac 
surgical intensive care unit for monitoring. She developed 
ischemic changes on her EKG and was taken to the cardiac 
catheterization lab where a kink was seen in her left internal 
mammary artery graft to her left anterior descending artery. 
Stenting was also performed to her right coronary artery. She 
was thus returned to the operating room where she underwent a 
revision of her left internal mammary artery graft. 
Postoperatively she was returned to the cardiac surgical 
intensive care unit for monitoring. Hemodialysis was resumed as 
per preop. On postoperative day one, her permanent pacemaker was 
interrogated by the electrophysiology service. Plavix was 
started for anticoagulation for her stents. As she had some 
clotting of her hemodialysis line, a new one was inserted over a 
wire. On [**3501-2-14**], Ms. [**Known patient lastname 10397**] became less responsive with right 
upper extremity weakness and a stroke service consult was 
obtained. A head CT was performed which showed multiple infarcts 
in the parietooccipital regions bilaterally. Heparin as a bridge 
to Coumadin was started for anticoagulation and her blood 
pressures were maintained higher. The occupational and physical 
therapy services were consulted for assistance with her care. 
Tube feeds were started for nutritional support. Diflucan and 
Levaquin were started for a urinary tract infection. On [**3501-2-18**], 
Ms. [**Known patient lastname 10397**] was extubated. She was able to follow commands and 
move all four extremities although her right upper extremity 
remained weaker. Seroquel was used for occasional agitation. On 
postoperative day nine, Ms. [**Known patient lastname 10397**] had a increase in her white 
blood cell count and pan cultures were sent. A PICC line was 
placed for intravenous access. The transplant service was 
consulted for evaluation for placement of a fistula versus a 
tunnelled catheter, however elected to wait until her culture 
data returned. Vancomycin was started as her catheter tip 
revealed staph on culture. A right internal jugular perma cath 
was placed for hemodialysis. On [**3501-2-25**], Ms. [**Known patient lastname 10397**] became more 
lethargic and hypotensive requiring Neo-Synephrine. An 
infectious disease consult was obtained who recommended an 
chest/abdominal CT scan to rule out infection. Antibiotics were 
continued. On [**3501-2-26**], a chest and abdominal CT was performed 
which revealed extensive atheromatous disease involving the 
aorta as well as the visceral arteries, probable hepatic and 
splenic infarcts and probable colitis in the distal colon. A 
blood culture grew gram positive cocci and  broad spectrum 
antibiotics were started. Ms. [**Known patient lastname 10397**] was reintubated and a 
transesophageal echocardiogram was performed which showed 
diffuse, complex atheroma of the thoracic aorta and thrombus 
versus vegetation associated with indwelling catheter. No 
valvular vegetations were seen. Her PICC line was changed. The 
general surgery service was consulted to assist in her care. On 
[**3501-2-28**], Ms. [**Known patient lastname 10397**] had rapid deterioration in her blood 
pressure. A chest x-ray revealed a tension pneumothorax which 
was treated with a chest tube with improvement in her vital 
signs. Total parental nutrition was started for nutritional 
support to rest her bowels. Her liver enzymes continued to trend 
upwards and a right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed. 
This revealed an ill-defined hypoechoic region in the right 
lobe/dome of the liver, corresponding to the area of suspected 
hepatic infarct. No cholelithiasis was observed. Her lipase 
became elevated suggesting pancreatitis. Ms. [**Known patient lastname 10397**] remained on 
blood pressure support. She became febrile despite antibiotic 
treatment. 
A repeat CT scan of her abdomen revealed no significant change 
when compared to the prior study. The appendix was not 
definitely visualized. The intrapelvic loops of small bowel were 
unremarkable. There was a small amount of free fluid in the 
pelvis. 
Again noted is probable thickening of the rectosigmoid wall and 
there was interval increase in the anasarca. The general surgery 
service took Ms. [**Known patient lastname 10397**] to the operating room where she 
underwent a laparotomy. She was found to have extensive ischemia 
of the small and large bowel and during resection became 
hemodynamically unstable and needed to be rushed back to cardiac 
intensive care unit for monitoring. Per her families request, 
support was withdrawn and Ms. [**Known patient lastname 10397**] [**Last Name (Titles) 3628**] on [**3501-3-5**] at 2:15 
AM.

     CONTRAST:  Oral contrast was administered.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN W/O IV CONTRAST:
     
     FINDINGS: There is minimal, patchy ground-glass opacity within the right lower
     and middle lobes laterally and atelectasis at the left base.  Pericardial
     thickening vs small pericardial effusion.  The liver contains a 6-mm round,
     hypodense lesion in the left lobe and a second, tiny hypodense lesion in the
     right lobe superiorly.  These are too small to accurately characterize.  The
     pancreas, spleen and adrenal glands appear unremarkable.  The kidneys are
     small and lobulated bilaterally. There are striations within the renal cortex,
     particularly on the left, probably related to recent administration of
     contrast.  Small amount of nonspecific stranding adjacent to the left kidney.
     There are prominent calcifications of the abdominal aorta consistent with
     arthromatis disease.  The large and small bowel loops are normal in caliber.
     No free air within the abdomen.  There is a retroperitoneal hematoma extending
     from the right groin along the right flank to approximately the level of the
     lower pole of the right kidney.  This does not involve the psoas muscle.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS W/O IV CONTRAST: A retroperitoneal hematoma is present
     tracking within the retroperitoneal space from the level of the right groin
     puncture site.  The largest focal collection of hemorrhage measures 3.3 x 4.5-
     cm.  The bladder, rectum and sigmoid colon are displaced to the left
     hemipelvis by the retroperitoneal hemorrhage.  A Foley catheter is in place
     within the bladder and there is air consistent with Foley catheter insertion.
     The adnexae appear unremarkable.  The uterus is not visualized.

     HISTORY: Preoperative CABG on 70-year-old female with coronary artery disease.
     
     TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS:
     
     Duplex evaluation of bilateral carotid arteries was performed. On the right
     peak systolic ICA velocity is 223/63 cm/second; CCA is 52/14 cm/second, ECA 75
     cm/second, corresponding to ICA:CCA ratio of 4.3. On the left peak ICA
     velocity is 112/29 cm/second, CCA 57/17 cm/second, ECA 134 cm/second,
     corresponding to ICA/CCA ratio of 1.7. Antegrade flow is seen in both
     vertebral arteries with velocity of 33 cm/second on the right and 56 cm/second
     on the left. Mild plaque formation is seen in carotid bifurcation, greater on
     the right at the ostium of the proximal right internal carotid artery.
     
     IMPRESSION: Plaque formation seen at the bilateral carotid bifurcations,
     associated with a 60-69% stenosis in the right internal carotid artery and a
     less than 40% stenosis in the left internal carotid artery.

     HISTORY:  A 71-year-old woman with Quinton catheter placement for
     hemodialysis, now with intermittent clogging.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 510**] and Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 250**], the attending physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 3339**] was present and supervising throughout.
     Informed consent was obtained and preprocedure timeout was performed.  The
     patient's right neck and upper chest were prepped and draped in standard
     sterile fashion.  Heparin was aspirated from both lumens.  The distal lumen
     aspirated and flushed freely.  The proximal lumen demonstrated very sluggish
     aspiration.  Lidocaine 1% was then infused along the tunnel tract.  Two
     Amplatz wires were advanced through the lumens of the existing dialysis
     catheter.  The cuff was freed with blunt dissection and the catheter was
     removed.  A new 19-cm coughed-tip tunneled hemodialysis catheter was advanced
     over the wires under fluoroscopic guidance.  The wires were removed.  Both
     ports demonstrated brisk aspiration and flushing.  The catheter was flushed
     and hep locked and secured with 0 Prolene sutures.  Final chest image
     demonstrated appropriate positioning of the line tip in the right atrium.  The
     patient tolerated the procedure well and there are no immediate postprocedure
     complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Successful exchange of nonfunctioning right IJ hemodialysis catheter for a new

     regions, there are multiple small foci of decreased attenuation involving both
     the white and [**Doctor Last Name 63**] matter, which represent multiple small infarcts.  Given the
     lack of a specific vascular distribution and the multiplicity of these, this
     likely represents an embolic phenomenon.  There is no shift of normally
     midline structures.  There is no intracranial hemorrhage. In the
     periventricular white matter, there are several foci of decreased attenuation,
     consistent with chronic microvascular angiopathy.  Additionally, within the
     right caudate, there is an old lacunar infarct.  There is almost complete soft
     tissue opacification of the right maxillary sinus.  The remainder of the soft
     tissue and osseous structures are normal.
     
     IMPRESSION: Multiple foci of decreased attenuation involving both the [**Doctor Last Name 63**] and
     white matter in the parietooccipital regions bilaterally, which likely
     represent infarcts.  Given the lack of a specific vascular distribution and
     the multiplicity of these, this likely is an embolic phenomenon.  No
     intracranial hemorrhage.
     
     Results were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8054**] on [**3501-2-14**] at 3:20 p.m.

     COMPARISON:  [**3501-2-14**].
     
     INDICATION:  Status post coronary artery bypass surgery.
     
     There has been interval extubation.  Other lines and tubes remain in
     satisfactory position, although note is made of kinking the left internal
     jugular vascular sheath near the skin insertion site.  The cardiac silhouette
     is enlarged.  There has been interval development of bilateral areas of
     perihilar haziness, as well as more confluent opacities in the left
     retrocardiac region and periphery of the right upper lobe.  Small pleural
     effusions are noted bilaterally and are new in the interval.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Interval extubation.
     2.  New multifocal pulmonary opacities, which may relate to asymmetrical
     congestive heart failure, although superimposed process such as aspiration is
     also possible.  Follow-up radiographs suggested.

Explained to pt. that she had pulled NGT out earlier and that it would not be safe to leave her untied until she was mentally clearer. Moves all extremities equally and purposefully.
Takes ice chips without difficulty. 
Afib continues with wide range in BP related to HR and state of behavior. SBP 120's when at rest.
O2 changed to aerosol mask during the night due to desat with prongs (mouthbreathing).Pt. had sudden episode of desat when tunred onto left side. Breath sounds very ""crackly"". CPT done bilat but pt. not coughing any secretions. Repositioned in upright fashion with sao2 up to 98%. on 50% o2.

     PROCEDURE:  The procedure was performed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 643**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 259**] with Dr.
     [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1983**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2281**], the Attending Radiologist, being present and supervising.  The
     right upper extremity was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  Since no
     suitable superficial veins were visible, ultrasound was used for localization
     of a suitable vein. The right brachial vein was patent and compressible.
     After local anesthesia with 2 mls of 1% Lidocaine, the brachial vein was
     entered under ultrasonographic guidance with a 21-gauge needle.  A 0.018
     guidwire was advanced under fluoroscopy into the superior vena cava.  Based on
     the markers on the guidwire it was determined that a length of 35 cm would be
     suitable. The PICC line was trimmed to length and advanced over a 4-French
     introducer sheath under fluoroscopic guidance into the superior vena cava.
     The sheath was removed. The catheter was flushed.  A final chest x-ray was
     obtained.  The film demonstrates the tip to be in the superior vena cava just
     above the atrium.
     
     The line is ready for use.

     INDICATION:  Patient with indicated cardiac and surgical history.  Ongoing
     pressor requirements.  Rule out intraabdominal abscess.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial multidetector CT acquisitions of the abdomen and pelvis were
     acquired after the administration of oral and intravenous contrast.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3501-2-2**].
     
     CT THORAX:  A left pectoral defibrillator or pacemaker box is identified.  A
     right-sided PICC line as well as a dual-lumen jugular line are all in situ.
     There is evidence of extensive ground-glass change scattered throughout the
     lung parenchyma.  In addition, increased atelectasis is identified in the left
     lung base.  The ground-glass change likely reflects a degree of
     edema.  There is some mild intralobular septal thickening.  Postoperative
     changes are identified within the mediastinum, where there is extensive
     hardware including LIMA clips and right coronary stent.  In addition, there is
     evidence of a small pericardial effusion that has increased in size from
     [**3501-2-2**]. Significant LVH is seen.
     
     No evidence of dissection within the aorta, but there is extensive
     atherosclerotic disease within the entire thoracic and descending aorta.
     
     CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS:  Within the right lobe of the liver peripherally, at
     the junction of segments 5, 6, 7, and 8, is identified extensive
     hypoattenuation, probably a new development from [**3501-2-2**](That was an
     unenhanced exam), and likely representing hepatic infarction.  Small cyst is
     seen, unchanged in segment 2. The portal vein appears patent.  Status post
     cholecystectomy. There is no intra or extrahepatic biliary dilatation.  Normal
     pancreas.
     
     While the portal vein is patent, the hepatic artery appears extremely
     attenuated, as a separate origin from the abdominal aorta and the splenic
     artery. The splenic artery is heavily calcified. Spleen also contains
     extensive peripheral hypoattenuation consistent with infarction.  Again, this
     is probably a new development from [**3501-2-2**].
     
     Both adrenal glands are normal.  Both kidneys are small, but appears to show
     good nephrograms and excretion of contrast.  The ureters are not clearly
     visualized.

     corresponds to the region of suspected infarct on the comparison CT.  The
     liver is otherwise unremarkable, without focal lesions.  The portal vein
     demonstrates normal patent hepatopetal flow.  The spleen was not able to be
     imaged due to obstructing gas due to the coexisting pneumothorax.  There is no
     evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilation.
     
     LIVER DOPPLER EVALUATION:  The main portal and intrahepatic portal venous
     branches are patent and demonstrate normal appearing waveforms.  The hepatic
     arteries are patent and demonstrate normal appearing low resistant waveforms
     with brisk systolic upstroke and preserved diastolic flow.  The hepatic veins

     INDICATION:  This is a 70-year-old woman with pelvic retroperitoneal
     hemorrhage status post catheterization.  The patient now has increase in the
     right lower quadrant pain.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  A-MDCT axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were performed with
     oral and IV contrast:  150 cc of Optiray 350 were administered.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH ORAL AND IV CONTRAST:  Patient is status post median
     sternotomy and CABG.  There is a pacemaker with leads in unchanged position.
     There is a central line extending from the neck beyond the limits of the
     radiograph with the tip in the cavoatrial junction.  There is a dialysis line
     in the right iliac vein region.  There is a central line in the left iliac
     vein region, and there is an NG tube with the tip in the stomach.
     
     There are small bilateral pleural effusions.  There are atelectatic changes in
     the lung bases.  No obvious focal consolidations are seen in the lung bases.
     The appearance of the atelectatic changes are not significantly changed when
     compared to prior study.  There is again noted a wedge shape low attenuation
     focus in the right lobe of the liver, which is unchanged when compared to the
     prior study.  New low attenuation foci in segment 7 of the liver (2 image 18).
     The other low attenuation foci in the segment 2 of the liver is unchanged and
     too small to characterize.  There are again noted splenic infarcts.  The
     extension of the low attenuation area is increased when compared to the prior
     study.  The spleen demomnstrates increrased size of low attenuation area
     consistent with infarction. There are also multiple wedge- shaped bilateral
     hypoattenuation areas in the kidneys that are consistent with renal infarcts,
     new when compared to the prior study.  The adrenal glands are normal. The
     pancreas is within normal limits. The opacified loops of small bowel are
     unremarkable.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH ORAL AND IV CONTRAST:  Again noted is the resolving
     hematoma in the right pelvic retroperitoneum.  There is still a large fluid
     collection in the right groin which is unchanged when compared to prior study
     and measures 5.5 x 3.4 cm.  There is also another smaller fluid collection
     located just adjacent to a loop of bowel that measures 1.4 x 2.5 cm.
     
     FINDINGS:  No significant change when compared to the prior study.  The
     appendix is not definitely visualized.  The intrapelvic loops of small bowel

     oral and IV contrast:  150 cc of Optiray 350 were administered.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH ORAL AND IV CONTRAST:  Patient is status post median
     sternotomy and CABG.  There is a pacemaker with leads in unchanged position.
     There is a central line extending from the neck beyond the limits of the
     radiograph with the tip in the cavoatrial junction.  There is a dialysis line
     in the right iliac vein region.  There is a central line in the left iliac
     vein region, and there is an NG tube with the tip in the stomach.
     
     There are small bilateral pleural effusions.  There are atelectatic changes in
     the lung bases.  No obvious focal consolidations are seen in the lung bases.
     The appearance of the atelectatic changes are not significantly changed when
     compared to prior study.  There is again noted a wedge shape low attenuation
     focus in the right lobe of the liver, which is unchanged when compared to the
     prior study.  New low attenuation foci in segment 7 of the liver (2 image 18).
     The other low attenuation foci in the segment 2 of the liver is unchanged and
     too small to characterize.  There are again noted splenic infarcts.  The
     extension of the low attenuation area is increased when compared to the prior
     study.  The spleen demomnstrates increrased size of low attenuation area
     consistent with infarction. There are also multiple wedge- shaped bilateral
     hypoattenuation areas in the kidneys that are consistent with renal infarcts,
     new when compared to the prior study.  The adrenal glands are normal. The
     pancreas is within normal limits. The opacified loops of small bowel are
     unremarkable.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH ORAL AND IV CONTRAST:  Again noted is the resolving
     hematoma in the right pelvic retroperitoneum.  There is still a large fluid
     collection in the right groin which is unchanged when compared to prior study
     and measures 5.5 x 3.4 cm.  There is also another smaller fluid collection
     located just adjacent to a loop of bowel that measures 1.4 x 2.5 cm.
     
     FINDINGS:  No significant change when compared to the prior study.  The
     appendix is not definitely visualized.  The intrapelvic loops of small bowel
                                                                 (Over)

     2. Interval worsening of splenic infarcts and there is new bilateral renal
     infarcts.
     3. The hepatic artery is not visualized and this could be due to occlusion. 
     4. The appeareance of the rectosigmoid colon is unchanged when compared to
