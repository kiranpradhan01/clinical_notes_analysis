     CT angiography [**2857-2-15**].
     
     INDICATION:  Intraventricular hemorrhage, evaluate for vascular abnormality.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial noncontrast CT scans of the brain were obtained.
     Subsequently, contrast enhanced CT angiographic images were acquired and
     limited two-dimensional reformatted views are provided.
     
     This study was returned for dictation on [**2859-5-7**].
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     There is blood within the ventricles, especially in the right lateral
     ventricle, which is dilated.  A small amount of subarachnoid blood is also
     evident in the right sylvian fissure.
     
     [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation is preserved.  There is no shift of normally
     midline structures.
     
     There is a left mastoidectomy defect with a small amount of debris within it.
     There is mucosal thickening and fluid in the maxillary sinuses.
     
     CT angiography demonstrates an occluded right internal carotid artery from the
     level of the skull base through the cavernous portion.  There is
     reconstitution of the right anterior and middle cerebral arteries and a
     complete circle of [**Location (un) **] is visualized.  There are no aneurysms identified
     and no arteriovenous malformation is seen.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  CT of the brain demonstrates an intraventricular hemorrhage and right
     ventricular dilatation.  There is sinusitis.
     
     2)  CT angiography is somewhat limited but reveals no arteriovenous
     malformation or aneurysm.  There is an occluded right intracranial internal
     carotid artery.
                                                                 (Over)

Pt with labile blood pressure and neuro exam today, s/p head CT X2, ICP placement X2

Neuro: Pt's neuro status up and down today, at times alert and oriented X2-3, other times confused and sedate.  Pt brought down to CT angio this AM due to inability to obtain MRI.  After head CT, R ventric drain placed with some difficulty, no drainage noted except small ammt clotted blood. Repeat head CT obtained immediately afterwards to assess position and asses L ventricle.  Neurosurg back up to place second ICP drain, now to L ventricle, R ICP d/c'd.  ICPs ranging [**1-11**], good waveform and fluctuance noted in tubing, draining small ammts bloody CSF.  Pt agitated most of day, constantly pulling at IV tubing, a-line, foley EKG, etc.  Pt restrained at all times, able to sit and almost reach head toward hand despite mitts/restraints. Pt with episode of extreme agitation, sitting up in bed, trying to climb out, pulled out IV, so SICU HO in to eval and 2mg midaz given per order. Pt responded well, slept approx 40 minutes. Pt able to wake to stimulation/voice, able to answer simple questions and follow simple commands despite midaz.  Pupils 2-3mm and reactive all day, pt with present cough and gag, moving all extremities equally.   Pt rec'd 25gm mannitol this AM per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], also started on Dilantin (rec'd load in OSH).  no siezure acticity noted.

Resp: Lungs CTAB, sl congested cough which pt clears and swallows.  Pt placed on 2LNP as sats drift to 94% when asleep.

CV: Extremely labile BP this AM, SBP 100-150's most of day with swings down to 90's and up to 180's.  Nipride gtt titrated accordingly, see carevue for doses.  HR 60's this AM, occasionally down to 50's with rare ectopy noted. EKG obtained this AM and CPKs cycled to r/o MI due to hypertensive bleed situation.  R radial A-line leaking d/t pt constantly pulling at site. Pt pulled out 2 IVs, 2 18 G ivs placed today without difficulty.  Pulses easily palpable, pt on P-boots while in bed.

GI: ABd soft, bs present throughout. Pt remains NPO

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Intracranial bleed, now with acute tachypnea.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically-acquired contiguous axial images were obtained through
     the pulmonary vasculature after the administration of 100 cc of Optiray due to
     patient debility.  Multiplanar reformatted images were obtained.
     
     CTA OF THE CHEST:  No pulmonary emboli are identified.  There is no
     pericardial or pleural effusion.  There are atherosclerotic changes in the
     aorta.  The heart and great vessels are unremarkable.  There are coronary
     artery calcifications.  A tube is seen in the esophagus.  The patient is not
     intubated.  Small mediastinal lymph nodes are seen, none of which individually
     meet the size criteria for pathologic enlargement.  There is no axillary or
     hilar adenopathy.
     
     On lung windows, there is complete collapse of the left lower lobe with a
     soft-tissue density in the bronchus going to the left lobe compatible with a
     mucous plug.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are seen.
     
     Multiplanar reformatted images support the above findings.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) No pulmonary emboli.
     
     2) Mucous plugging in the airways extending to the left lower lobe resulting
     in left lower lobe collapse.
     
     3) Nonspecific mediastinal lymph nodes.
     
     4) Coronary artery calcifications and atherosclerotic changes in the aorta.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
       73 year old man with IVhemorrhage, Meningitis                                  
       
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Please evaluate for stroke and or abcess.                                       
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
     INDICATION:  Evaluate for stroke or abscess in a patient with intraventricular
     hemorrhage and meningitis.
     
     COMPARISON: Head CT [**2857-2-27**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1 weighted, T2 weighted, FLAIR and susceptibility MRI
     of the brain without and with IV gadolinium.  3D time of flight MR angiogram
     of the brain with multiplanar reformatted images.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is stable ventriculomegaly again with hemorrhage within both
     lateral ventricles and along the left frontal drainage tract.  Diffuse
     weighted images demonstrate restricted diffusion in the distribution of the
     right anterior cerebral artery, compatible with evolving infarct.  Post
     contrast images demonstrate periventricular enhancement and enhancement along
     the ependymal surface of the lateral ventricles and cervicomedullary junction.
     There is moderate leftward shift of the septum pellucidum.  There is slight
     mucosal thickening of the left maxillary sinus.
     
     MRA OF THE BRAIN:  There is no flow demonstrated within the right internal
     carotid artery.  Flow is seen is within both middle cerebral arteries,
     posterior cerebral arteries, and anterior cerebral arteries.  The vertebral
     arteries and basilar artery are patent.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.   Evolving infarct in the right anterior cerebral artery territory.
     
     2.   Ventriculomegaly with intraventricular hemorrhage and leftward shift of
     the septum pellucidum, not grossly changed compared with the recent CT scan.
     
     3.   Periventricular enhancement may partially be explained as a reactive
     phenomena to the intraventricular hemorrhage.  However, enhancement along the
     surface of the ventricles cervicomedullary junction and the cerebellum may be
     related to meningitis, as well.
     
     4.  No flow is demonstrated within the right internal carotid artery.
     This finding was also noted on a prior CT angiogram. 
     
                                                                 (Over)

Please see MICU transfer note. Briefly, pt is a 71 yr old male who was previously in the T-SICU after ICH (due to HTN). Pt had been treated in the ICU for hypertention and with ICP drain/monitor. Pt was transferred out to the floor, then readmitted to the MICU due to change in mental status and tachypnea. Pt was intubated for airway protection and due to tachypnea, ICP drain placed and pt lined up.  Pt transferred down to T-SICU today for further management.

ROS: Neuro: Pt remains unresponsive, slight flexion noted in BLE to pain only.  Pupils 2-3mm and sluggish to react, impaired cough and gag. No spont movement noted. ICP drain at 5cm above the tragus, open to drain with ICP transduced Q1hour. ICPs [**5-13**]. Drainage from ICP is bloody with some purulent matter noted. **WBC from ICP drianage >63,000** Pt continues on dilantin. Propofol gtt started in MICU to manage tachypnea, weaned off and changed to MSO4 Q1 hour for tachypnea.

CV: HR 80's, SR without ectopy. PO HTN meds had been held due to boarderline BP with propofol infusing.  Currently SBP 120-140's. Low hct today, pt receiving first of 2 U prbcs. Extremities warm and well perfused, weakly palpable pulses noted.  R A-line new today, RIJ site intact.  CVP 4-6.  Periph IV placed on arrival.

Resp: Tachypnea persists despite many vent changes. Currently pt is on 5PEEP/0PS with 50%.  ABG sl improved after MSO4 and suctioning. Lungs ronchorous throughout, suctioned for moderate ammts thick yellow sputum. ETT retaped on arrival.

GI: Abd round, distended with good BS throughout. TF at 50cc/hr.

GU/renal: Low u/o via foley catheter, LR fluid bolus given. Repeat lytes also sent due to hypernatremia, high serum osmos.  

Endo: Elevated glucose all day, insulin gtt titrated to manage sugars.

ID: Extremely high WBC from CSF fluid. ID recommended new IV ABX, awaiting meds from pharmacy.  plan for MRI to r/o cerebral abscess.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
        73 year old man with IVhemorrhage, Meningitis                                 
         
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      with DWI and perfusion, evaluate for evolution of stroke on prior MRI           
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
     MRI SCAN OF THE BRAIN WITH DIFFUSION WEIGHTED IMAGES
     
     HISTORY:  Meningitis. Evaluate for evolving infarction suspected in the area
     of the anterior cerebral artery as noted on an MR scan of a few days ago.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1 and T2 weighted brain imaging was obtained with
     diffusion weighted scans.
     
     FINDINGS:  The area of abnormal diffusion in the right anterior cerebral
     artery territory is redemonstrated. However, additional areas of restricted
     diffusion are also redemonstrated within the inferior aspect of both
     cerebellar hemispheres and in relationship to the periventricular white matter
     of the left lateral ventricle. All of these areas also show elevated T2
     signal, suggesting that a pathological process is at least subacute in age.
     The areas of susceptibility relating to the intraventricular hemorrhage and
     along the tract of the drainage catheter do not appear to have altered
     substantially. No gross change in ventricular size is appreciated, either.
     
     CONCLUSION:  Little change in markedly abnormal study as defined above.
     
     MR ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) 4**] AND ITS TRIBUTARIES:
     
     TECHNIQUE:  3-dimensional time-of-flight imaging with multiplanar
     reconstructions.
     
     FINDINGS:  Since the prior MRA of [**3-1**], there has been interval
     development of marked stenosis of the distal half of the basilar artery. There
     also appears to be markedly reduced flow in the distal intracranial portion of
     the right vertebral artery, aside from a short segment joining the distal left
     vertebral artery. The rapid change in vascular caliber over a few days would
     be consistent with vasospasm. There remains very poor cross-filling into the
     right middle cerebral artery. In fact, there does appear to be less prominent
     flow signal within the anterior cerebral artery complexes, likely a function
     of vasospasm, likely in the vicinity of the anterior communicating artery.
     
     CONCLUSION:
     Worsening of vascular flow patterns, suggesting interval development of
     vasospasm.
     
     
                                                                 (Over)
