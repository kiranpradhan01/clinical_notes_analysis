Admission Date:  [**3299-7-18**]       Discharge Date:  [**3299-8-6**]

Date of Birth:   [**3230-1-3**]       Sex:  M

Service:  ACOVE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 69-year-old male with
a history of renal cell cancer with metastasis to the right
lower lobe status post resection in [**3290**], who presented to
[**Hospital6 2076**] on [**7-16**] with complaints of several
days of hemoptysis.  Work-up there including a chest CT scan
showed a large mass obstructing the right mainstem bronchus.

The patient was transferred to [**Hospital6 102**] for interventional bronchoscopy.  At bronchoscopy, the
patient had Argon laser destruction of the right mainstem
mass, and a stent was placed in the bronchus to maintain
patency.  During the procedure, a significant amount of
bleeding, approximately 600 cc, was noted and controlled.

Following the procedure, the patient remained in the PACU
where his blood pressure had dropped to an SBP in the 70s.
He did received a 500 cc normal saline bolus and was started
on a Neo-Synephrine drip to maintain to his blood pressure.
He was then transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for
further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Coronary artery disease status
post myocardial infarction in [**3294**] and 1995, with discovered
left anterior descending disease and stent placement.
Echocardiogram in [**3295-9-19**] showed an ejection fraction
of 25%, mild aortic stenosis, 2+ mitral regurgitation, 1+
tricuspid regurgitation, and increased pulmonary artery
systolic pressure.  2.  Hypertension.  3.  Renal cell
carcinoma status post right nephrectomy in [**3273**] with
metastasis to the right lower lobe status post partial
resection in [**3290**].  No history of chemotherapy or
immunotherapy.  4.  Congestive heart failure.  5.  Type 2
diabetes mellitus.  6.  Gout.  7.  Chronic renal
insufficiency.  8.  History of detached left retina from
prior trauma.

ALLERGIES:  ASPIRIN WITH UNCLEAR SIDE AFFECT, ERYTHROMYCIN
WITH UNKNOWN ADVERSE REACTION.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Allopurinol 300 mg p.o. q.d.,
Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d., Lasix 80 mg p.o. q.d., Avandia 8 mg
p.o. q.d., Toprol XL 25 mg p.o. q.d., Ceftriaxone 1 g IV q.24
hours.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has a 30 pack-year history of
smoking; he quit in [**3282**].  Rare alcohol use.  The patient
denied other drug use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  On admission temperature
was 96.3��, heart rate 79, blood pressure 107/55 on
Neo-Synephrine, Propofol drip, respirations 8, oxygen
saturation 100% on SIMV, 600/8/5/60%.  General:  The patient
was a sedated, intubated male.  HEENT: Left surgical pupil
and right pupil reactive to light.  Neck:  No jugular venous
distention.  No bruit.  Supple.  Lungs:  Decreased breath
sounds on the right side anteriorly.  Cardiovascular:  Faint
S1 and S2.  There was a 2 out of 6 systolic murmur at the
left upper sternal border.  Regular, rate and rhythm.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.  Positive bowel
sounds.  Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
There were 2+ distal pulses bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission white count was 8.9,
hematocrit 31.9, platelet count 228; INR 1.1, PT 13.0, PTT
26.6; electrolytes with a sodium of 145, potassium 4.2,
chloride 108, bicarb 25, BUN 35, creatinine 1.9, glucose 189;
arterial blood gas with pH of 7.35, pCO2 49, pO2 206.

IMPRESSION:  This was a 69-year-old male with a distant
history of renal cell carcinoma of the right kidney status
post resection in [**3273**] with recurrence in [**3289**] to the right
lower lobe status post wedge resection with new mass
obstructing the right mainstem bronchus, likely from
recurrence of renal cell carcinoma.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Pulmonary:  After discovery of a mass
obstructing the right mainstem bronchus, the patient was
brought to [**Hospital6 273**] for
debridement of the mass and right mainstem bronchus stenting
on [**7-18**].

A repeat bronchoscopy done on [**7-19**] showed that the stent
remained in good position.  The patient was started on a
course of intravenous Solu-Medrol per the instructions of the
Interventional Pulmonary Team.  This was later changed to a
Prednisone taper to address issues of airway edema.

The patient was placed on a course of antitussive agents
including Benzonatate and Robitussin AC to suppress his
persistent cough.  Photodynamic therapy was used for further
treatment of this obstructing lesion on [**7-28**].  A
photosensitizing [**Doctor Last Name 11**] was administered, and laser treatment
through bronchoscopy was done on [**7-30**].  Bronchoscopy
for debridement was done on [**7-31**].

Repeat bronchoscopy and laser treatment was accomplished on
[**8-3**] with subsequent debridement again on [**8-5**].  Serial chest x-rays showed improved right lung aeration.

The patient was maintained on 2 L oxygen nasal cannula
throughout the majority of his stay, and then was ultimately
weaned to room air.

2.  Oncology:  Radiation/Oncology was consulted, and they
administered a course of palliated radiation therapy that
included a total of 14 treatments beginning on [**7-19**].
The cumulative dose of the treatments was 3600 cgy to his
chest area for the treatment of this right mainstem bronchus
mass.

On [**7-28**], the Hematology/Oncology Team was consulted,
and it was determined that this patient was not a candidate
for immunotherapy or investigational protocol at this time
due to his multiple other medical problems including
decompensated congestive heart failure.  A referral was made
to the Biologics Clinic to discuss further options regarding
ongoing treatment for this likely metastatic renal cell
carcinoma.

The pathology report of the tissue obtained from the initial
bronchoscopy showed that the findings were compatible with a
metastatic renal cell carcinoma, especially considering the
patient's history; however, the possibility of a lung primary
or of other origin could not be excluded.

3.  Hematology:  The patient requires Erythropoietin at
baseline for anemia related to his chronic renal
insufficiency.  He did require 2 U of packed red blood cells
following the initial bronchoscopy due to significant
intraoperative bleeding.  Following that transfusion, his
hematocrit did remain above 30 throughout the remainder of
his hospital stay.

4.  Endocrine:  The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes.
He was kept on a regular Insulin sliding scale throughout his
hospital stay for control of his blood sugar.  He was begun
on a course of Glipizide in preparation for discharge.

5.  Cardiovascular:  The patient has a known history of
congestive heart failure with a poor ejection fraction.  The
patient was markedly fluid overloaded on arrival to the
Medicine Floor.  He was aggressively diuresed with
intravenous Lasix b.i.d., reaching a dose of 80 mg b.i.d.

The patient was kept on a fluid restriction of less than 1500
cc/day.  He was also continued on his usual beta-blocker
regimen and the ACE inhibitor.  Lisinopril was started, as
the patient reached euvolemia.

A Cardiology consult was obtained for further recommendations
in the treatment of his congestive heart failure.  Follow-up
with his private cardiologist was arranged.  He was continued
on Lipitor throughout his hospital stay for his coronary
artery disease.

6.  Renal:  The patient did have acute on chronic renal
failure during his hospital stay which did improve with
ongoing treatment through diuresis that likely improved his
systolic function.  Nephrotoxic medications were withheld
during this period.  The patient was at his baseline renal
function upon discharge.

7.  Infectious disease:  Pneumonia was suspected on the
patient's initial chest x-ray, but the patient never had a
fever, elevated white count or significant productive cough
throughout his hospital stay.  The initial course of
Ceftriaxone was discontinued when chest x-ray no longer
supported evidence of consolidation.

8.  Psychiatry:  The patient did gain insight into the
terminal nature of his disease.  He was at times despondent
but did improve throughout his hospital stay with the help of
the Oncology Social Worker and the support of his family
members.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Pulmonary mass.
2.  Acute on chronic renal failure.
3.  Congestive heart failure.
4.  Hemoptysis.
5.  Renal cell carcinoma.
6.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus.

     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Right main stem bronchus stent.  Evaluate for congestive
     heart failure and for right lung collapse.
     
     Comparison is made to previous study of 1 day earlier.
     
     A stent remains in place in the right main stem bronchus.  There is a large
     rounded opacity in the region of the right hilum and there is persistent
     collapse of the right middle and right lower lobe.  The heart size is enlarged
     but stable.  The aorta is tortuous.  The pulmonary vascularity appears
     slightly engorged but there is no overt evidence of pulmonary edema.  There
     has been interval improvement and left retrocardiac opacity with minimal
     patchy opacity remaining in this region.
     
     Surgical clips are noted in the right hemithorax.  A small right pleural
     effusion is unchanged.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1)  Right main stem bronchus stent is in place with persistent
     collapse of right middle and right lower lobes.  There is an unusual rounded
     opacity in the central portion of the right lung which is suspicious for a
     neoplastic mass.
      Correlative CT imaging may be helpful for a more complete assessment.
     
     2)  Small right pleural effusion.

     A right main stem bronchus stent remains in place.  There is persistent
     collapse of the right middle and right lower lobes and there remains a mass-
     like area of opacity centrally in the right hilar region.  A small right
     pleural effusion is unchanged.
     
     The cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  The imaged portion of the

     CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST:
     
     COMPARISON; The outside chest CT is not available for comparison.
     
     FINDINGS:   There is a stent within the right mainstem bronchus. There is a
     fluid level within the stent and there is soft tissue opacification in the
     distal portion of the stent. There is evidence of prior partial lung resection
     on the right and there is marked volume loss on the right. There is dense
     opacity with air bronchograms throughout the right lower and middle lobes.
     There is residual aeration towards the apex, but with consolidative change
     present within it.  Evaluation is somewhat limited on this noncontrast study.
     There are a few prominent lymph nodes in the right paratracheal region
     superiorly measuring 12 mm on image 13 of series 4 and in the right tracheal
     bronchial region adjacent to but not compressing the stent measuring 8 mm.
     There is no real subcarinal adenopathy.  There is no effusion on the right.
     There is a 1 cm right sided pericardial lymph node  as well. There is motion
     artifact degrading detail and evaluation of the left lung which is largely
     clear apart from compressive atelectatic changes adjacent to a small dependent
     pleural effusion.  There are two small nodules in the right lower lobe, each
     less than 4 mm.  There are no masses or areas of consolidation. There is
     extensive coronary artery calcification and the heart appears enlarged. There
     is no pneumothorax.  There is some thickening of the left adrenal gland. There
     is a 1.8 cm exophytic lesion with hounsfield units of 33 arising from the
     superior pole of the left kidney. This is not well characterized on this
     noncontrast exam. The remainder of the upper abdomen reveals no suspicious
     findings. The bones are unrevealing.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Postoperative changes with collapse and consolidative changes throughout
     the right lung.  No discrete mass is identified on this noncontrast exam,

     2.  A few prominent mediastinal lymph nodes meeting criteria for enlargment
     but no bulky adenopathy and no extrinsic mass effect upon the bronchial stent.
     3.  Small left sided pleural effusion and two small left lower lobe pulmonary
     nodules.

     AP UPRIGHT CHEST:  Comparison is made with [**3299-10-14**].  There is almost complete
     collapse of the right lung, with minimal residual aeration.  This is
     significantly changed from prior chest radiograph, but similar to the scout
     image on the CT of the chest on the same day.  There is no pneumothorax or
     pneumomediastinum.  There is deviation of the trachea towards the right.  The
     left lung is grossly clear, but evaluation is slightly limited due to
     respiratory motion.  No left pleural effusion.  An endobroncheal stent is no
     longer visualized.  
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Near complete collapse of the right lung.  This is likely due to to post-
     obstructive collapse and pneumonitis.  No pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.

Follows commands inconsistently- able to squeeze R hand, very weak grip to L hand, moves toes of bilat. LE's but not on command.  Unable to determine sensory status in extremities.  Pt. able to state last name, knows he's @ the ""[**Hospital1 **]"", ? if knows month or not as pt. becomes lethargic rapidly and dozes while being spoken to.  Received 100mg IV Dilantin @ 23:00- Dilantin level subtherapeutic @ 20:00- 8.6.  Dilantin level with a.m. labs 20.  Witnessed 45 second seizure @ 2:50 a.m.  Pt. alert @ this time, was communicating verbally though minimally.  Began to have forceful tremors to q 4 extremities, more pronounced to LUE.  Responded when called by first name during seizure, was able to track with eyes.  Notified team who eval'd. pt. shortly after seizure.  Seizure broke on its own.  Origin of seizures likely stroke but unknown if stroke is embolic is watershed in origin. MRI done yesterday was poor image d/t extensive artifact. 

CV:  HR 70's-80's NSR w/o ectopy.  SBP low 90's-low 100's- unchanged during seizure.  Palpable peripherals, 2+-3+ edema to q 4 extremities.
