HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 83-year-old
female with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, seizure disorder, who presented at the
[**Hospital3 **] with hypoxia and respiratory distress.

The patient had recently been admitted to the [**Hospital6 10954**] from [**3-16**] to [**3-25**] with respiratory distress
requiring intubation.  She was treated for chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation with steroids,
antibiotics including Vancomycin and Cefepime for pneumonia,
and was extubated after two or three days.  The patient was
also treated for hypertensive urgency requiring transient
Labetalol drip.

The patient was discharged back to the [**Hospital3 **] on [**3-25**] on p.o. dose of Levaquin.  At that time, her white blood
cell count was 19.  She was having low-grade fevers on her
steroid taper, and she had a loculated right pleural effusion
for which the patient had refused thoracentesis.

On [**2602-3-27**], the patient was found by the family at the
[**Hospital3 **] to have increased respiratory rate and looked
purplish in her extremities.  Her oxygen saturation was found
to be 72% on 2 L which decreased to 63% on 4 L.  The patient
was then transferred to the [**Hospital6 102**].

The patient had a blood pressure of 176/44, pulse 110, and
oxygen saturation of 70% on nonrebreather and was intubated
for respiratory distress with subsequent hypotension after
induction.

The patient had a chest x-ray after intubation which showed
prominent right hilar area concerning for vascular
abnormality.  A transesophageal echocardiogram was performed
in the Emergency Room which revealed no evidence of
dissection, normal right ventricular size and function, no
acute changes consistent with PE, and normal ejection
fraction greater than 55%.

The patient also had left ventricular hypertrophy with a
small left ventricle.  Due to her hypotension, the patient
received approximately 6 L of intravenous fluid in the
Emergency Room.  She was also given Ceftriaxone and Flagyl,
as well as Lasix.

In the Intensive Care Unit, the patient was initially
hypotensive to the 90s/50s and was given another liter of
normal saline with mild response.  She had a right IJ and
right arterial line in place.  Initial CVP was [**6-27**] after 1 L
normal saline.

The patient required subsequent fluid boluses and Levophed
for a ................ less than 60.  She was pancultured and
continued on antibiotics.

The patient underwent bronchoscopy while intubated which
showed that the trachea and left side of the bronchi were
within normal limits.  The right lower lobe bronchus mucosa
was slightly pale.  Biopsies were taken from the superior
segment of the right lower lobe mucosa, as well as BAL
brushings were obtained.  There was extrinsic narrowing of
the right lower lobe superior segment bronchus.

The patient also had a deep venous thrombosis detected by
lower extremity ultrasound and was started on a Heparin drip.

She continued to have difficult elevated blood pressures
requiring Hydralazine IV.

The patient was extubated on [**2602-3-30**], after one day of
observation postbronchoscopy.

The patient was then transferred to the ACOVE Medicine
Service on [**2602-3-31**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Intensive Care Unit course:  The
patient's Intensive Care Unit course as outline in above HPI.
To summarize, the patient had acute shortness of breath with
chest pain and anxiety at her rehabilitation facility after
being discharged from the [**Hospital6 98**] on p.o.
Levofloxacin after having a loculated pleural effusion and
pneumonia requiring intubation.  In the Emergency Department,
she was hypotensive and hypoxic requiring intubation.  She
received a significant amount of volume resuscitation.  She
was treated with intravenous antibiotics, initially
Ceftriaxone and Flagyl and then switched to Ceftazidime and
Vancomycin given her recent hospital stay.

The patient's chest x-ray showed question of wide mediastinum
but no evidence of PE or dissection by transesophageal
echocardiogram.

Other issues included hyponatremia, acute renal failure with
a creatinine of 2.1 which has since resolved.  The patient
was initially treated with steroids for presumed adrenal
insufficiency; however, cortisol stimulation test was fine,
and steroids were discontinued.

The patient was also treated with Bicarbonate for metabolic
acidosis.  The patient was treated with Heparin drip for deep
venous thrombosis.  The patient had bronchoscopy with
brushings and biopsy on [**3-29**] and was extubated on [**3-30**].  The patient also had labile hypertension controlled with
intravenous antihypertensives.  The patient had anemia which
was treated with 1 U of packed red blood cells.

2.  Lung cancer:  The patient had right lower lobe biopsy
which did not show any definite malignancy.  The patient had
bronchial brushings which showed rare atypical cells and
reactive bronchial cells and acute inflammation.  She also
had bronchial washings which were positive for malignant
cells consistent with non-small cell carcinoma with features
suggestive of squamous differentiation.

A family meeting with the patient's son, daughter-in-law and
medical team was had to discuss the new diagnosis of lung
cancer.

The patient was with a chest CT revealing a 6.2 x 5.4 cm low
attenuation lesion in the superior segment of the right lower
lobe of the lung.  The patient had a large 3.5 cm low density
lesion within the liver with peripheral enhancement, likely
metastatic disease.  The patient also has a well
circumscribed small right adrenal lesion and apparently
enhancing nodule with an area of ascites anterior to the
liver.  These findings were all consistent with the diagnosis
of metastatic lung cancer.

The patient also had head CT which did not reveal any
evidence of metastatic lesions; however, study was suboptimal
to detect these lesions, as it was done for other purposes.

The overall plan of care was to continue treatment of the
patient's other medical conditions.  The patient remained
full code.  A discussion was had with Social Work, Case
Management, Palliative Care, Oncology, and Primary Medical
Team with the family given that the patient would be a poor
candidate for therapy.

Oncology saw the patient and deemed that survival in patients
with this diagnosis is eight months, and given co-medical
conditions in this patient, the prognosis is likely much
worse.  Goal of treatment is palliative which includes
chemotherapy and radiation therapy, as well as supportive
care.

Her comorbidities would make it difficult for her to tolerate
chemotherapy or radiation.  The decision regarding role of
palliative radiation therapy in this patient with a history
of chronic low back pain requiring high doses of MS Contin
for over 10-20 years, make it less likely that palliative
radiation therapy would be of any benefit.  This was also
reviewed with the patient's son who agreed.

The patient will likely go back to her nursing home, and if
she has any further decompensations, the family will then
reassess at that time whether to bring her back to the
hospital for more aggressive care or to decide to change the
goal to comfort care.

The hospital course from a cancer view point was otherwise
stable.

3.  Deep venous thrombosis:  The patient was initially
maintained on Heparin drip.  She was then started on Coumadin
and reached therapeutic INR.  The goal INR will be between 2
and 3, and the patient is currently on a dose of Coumadin 2.5
mg p.o. q.d.

4.  Question stroke:  The patient had supratherapeutic PTT
and hematocrit drop, as well as questionable left-sided
weakness and had head CT on [**4-2**] which was negative for
evidence of acute bleed.  The patient also had full return of
her neurological status without any focal neurological
deficits.

5.  Hypertension:  The patient had hypertension that was
difficult to control and required intravenous medications,
initially Hydralazine; however, the patient was gradually
changed over to a p.o. regimen and had good control of her
blood pressure between 130s and 160s systolic on a regimen of
Clonodine 2 patches q.week, Lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q.d.,
Labetalol 200 mg p.o. t.i.d., Norvasc 5 mg p.o. q.d.

6.  FEN:  The patient has a speech and swallow evaluation
which showed that she would be able to take purees and thin
liquids.  She was able to tolerate a reasonable amount of
p.o. intake.

7.  Anxiety:  The patient is on Klonopin as an outpatient and
had not been restarted on this medication.  This was
restarted on [**2602-4-5**].  The patient will also be
restarted on her Celexa.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable, but the patient is
definitely below her baseline function and mental status.
The goal is that with supportive care and return to familiar
environment, the patient will have improvement in mental
status, as well as resumption of her Benzodiazepine which she
has been on for many years.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Pneumonia.
2.  Deep venous thrombosis.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Metastatic lung cancer.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient will need her INR followed with a
goal INR between 2 and 3.  The patient is currently with an
INR greater than 3 on a dose of Coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. q.d.

The patient can follow-up with her primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**Last Name (STitle) **] at the nursing home as needed.

     INDICATION:  Acute shortness of breath with low oxygenation, rule out
     pneumonia.
     
     AP CHEST:  There are no prior studies for comparison.  The heart size is
     within normal limits.  The aorta is tortuous and unfolded.  There is an extra
     opacity at the level of the ascending aorta and an aneurysm cannot be
     excluded.  There is increased opacity within the right lung apex.  No other
     focal opacities are present.  There is an old fracture of the right humeral
     head.  There is blunting of both costophrenic angles indicative of pleural
     thickening versus small effusions.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  A bulge over the right hilum in the region of the ascending aorta, and
     aneurysm cannot be excluded.  A chest CT with contrast is recommended for
     further evaluation.
     
     This was discussed with the ED physician caring for the patient at approx. 7
     pm on the day of the study.

     INDICATION:  CVL placement. Hypoxia.
     
     Comparison: [**2602-3-27**] - 17:19
     
     FINDINGS:  The tip of the endotracheal tube remains very close to the carina
     (2.1 cm). This should be pulled back. A right internal jugular line has been
     placed with the tip in the SVC/no pneumothorax. Compared to the prior study,
     the bulging appearance near the right hilum appears to have progressed and is
     now blending into air space disease. This likely represents an evolving
     pneumonia. The pulmonary vascular markings are stable and not substantially
     dilated.
     
     There is new atelectasis at the left lung base and likely a small effusion as
     well. Cardiac silhouette appears slightly enlarged but shallow, level of
     inspiration may contribute or be responsible.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Progressive air space disease in the right mid-lung field suspicious for
     evolving pneumonia.
     
     Right IJ placement - no pneumothorax.
     
     ET tube 2.1 cm above carina.
     
     New atelectasis/effusion at left lung base.

     INDICATION:  Respiratory distress status post intubation.
     
     Comparison film from earlier the same day.
     
     AP CHEST:  An ET tube is now present whose tip is approximately 1 cm from the
     carina.  This should be drawn back at least 2 cm.  The focal bulge overlying
     the right hilum has increased in size.  Given the short interval between exams
     a vascular abnormality is a strong consideration.  There is stable blunting of
     both costophrenic angles.  There are no focal infiltrates.  There is an old
     fracture of the right humeral head.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  ET tube should be withdrawn a few centimeters.
     2.  Focal bulge over the right hilum.  While this could represent a middle
     mediastinal mass such as a tumor or lymphadenopathy, a vascular origin must be
     excluded.

     FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube is now 3.5 cm above the carina. Right CVL
     remains in place. Perihilar opacity is not significantly changed. A left
     effusion is noted and poor delineation of the left hemidiaphragm is seen, the
     latter consistent with atelectasis or possibly developing pneumonia. Pulmonary
     vasculature is unchanged. There is no pneumothorax.

     BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY DOPPLER EXAMINATION:
     
     INDICATION:  82 y/o female with hypoxic respiratory failure.  Evaluate for
     DVT.
     
     FINDINGS:  Grayscale and color Doppler sonographic examination of the
     bilateral lower extremity venous system was performed.  There is evidence of
     an intraluminal thrombus within the right common femoral vein which is not
     occlusive and does not extend into the greater saphenous vein.  Within the
     remainder of the exam there is evidence of normal wave form, color flow, and
     compressibility within the bilateral superficial femoral veins, and popliteal
     veins.  There is also evidence of normal color flow and wave form within the
     left common femoral vein.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Non-occlusive intraluminal thrombus identified within the right
     common femoral vein.  These findings were called to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 11323**] at
     approximately 4:30 pm on [**2602-3-29**].

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATIONS: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, recent pneumonia. Apparent
     hilar mass on recent chest radiograph. 
     
     CT THORAX:  Comparison is made to previous films from  [**3-28**] and [**2602-3-27**].
     
     Helical CT of the thorax was performed following IV administration of 100 cc
     of Optiray.  Nonionic contrast was administered due to debilitated status of
     the patient.   Images were acquired with 5 mm columnation and reconstructed at
     5 mm intervals throughout the thorax.
     
     Soft tissue structures of the thorax demonstrate bilateral pleural effusions,
     which are small in size and predominantly dependent in distribution.  There is
     bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy (right greater than left) and
     there are also numerous mediastinal lymph nodes with some measuring slightly
     greater than 1 cm in diameter in the precarinal and subcarinal regions.
     Additional enlarged nodes are seen in the azygoesophageal recess, although
     this is difficult to separate from the superior segment right lower lobe mass.
     Within the superior segment of the right lower lobe, there is a large low
     attenuation region with peripheral enhancement, measuring approximately 6.3 x
     5.4 cm in diameter. This does not contain air bronchograms. More over, the
     bronchus to the superior segment of the right lower lobe is not clearly
     identified, suggesting that it is obstructed.
     
     The heart is upper limits of normal in size. Coronary artery calcifications
     are noted.  No pericardial effusion is evident.
     
     Imaging of the upper portion of the abdomen demonstrates fullness of the right
     adrenal gland with an approximately 1.9 x 1.0 cm diameter smoothly marginated
     lesion in the right adrenal gland. The left adrenal gland demonstrates no
     evidence of discrete mass. The imaged portions of the kidneys demonstrate a
     few small low attenuation lesions which are too small to characterize but are
     statistically most likely due to cysts.  Within the liver, adjacent to the
     gallbladder fossa, there is a large low attenuation lesion with lobulated
     borders measuring approximately 3.5 x 3.5 cm in diameter with an area of
     peripheral enhancement.  Note is made of the presence of ascites. The
     gallbladder appears distended.  The spleen demonstrates heterogenous
     enhancement, likely representing phase of contrast administration. There is a
     questionable small enhancing nodule within the area of ascites in the right
     abdomen anteriorly.  Some periportal edema is noted.
     
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT
     (Cont)
     There is aneurysmal dilation of the abdominal aorta measuring up to
     approximately 3.4 x 3.1 cm in diameter with peripheral thrombus noted.  This
     appears to dilate just below the origin of the renal arteries.
     
     Assessment of the lungs reveals bilateral smoothly marginated septal
     thickening.  Areas of consolidation are seen in the right lower lobe adjacent
     to the above described mass.  There is some extrinsic compression on the
     bronchus intermedius  and common basilar trunk of the right lower lobe
     bronchus.   Areas of increased opacity are seen in the left lower lobe
     adjacent to the pleural effusion and probably reflect atelectasis, with some
     associated volume loss, manifested by shift of the left major fissure.    An
     endotracheal tube is noted, in satisfactory position. Note is made of some
     thickening of the posterior wall of the right upper lobe bronchus.
     
     Skeletal structures of the thorax demonstrate a healed lower right anterior
     rib fracture.  No suspicious focal lytic or blastic skeletal lesions are
     observed.
     
     Note is made of calcified pleural plaques in the left hemithorax anteriorly.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Large low attenuation lesion with peripheral enhancement within the
     superior segment of the right lower lobe, measuring 6.2 x 5.4 cm in diameter.
     There is apparent associated obstruction of the superior segment right lower
     lobe bronchus, and there is some mass effect on the bronchus intermedius and
     proximal right lower lobe bronchi below the take off of the superior segment
     bronchus.  The observed findings are concerning for primary bronchogenic
     carcinoma.  A lung abscess is considered less likely.
     
     2.  Mediastinal lymphadenopathy, most prominent in the precarinal and
     subcarinal regions.
     
     3.  Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, right greater than left.
     
     4.  Bilateral small pleural effusions.
     
     5.  Large, 3.5 cm diameter low density lesion within the liver with some
     peripheral enhancement. Although possibly due to hemangioma, dedicated MR of
     the liver may be helpful for complete characterization in order to exclude
     metastatic disease. This may also help to clarify the etiology of a well
     circumscribed small right adrenal lesion and an apparent enhancing nodule
     located within an area of ascities anterior the liver.
     
     6.  Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     7.  Numerous thickened septal lines within the lungs, likely due to a

     8.  Distention of the gallbladder, incompletely imaged on this study.
     
     10. Periportal edema and ascites.  It is difficult to exclude a component of

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      82 year old woman with met lung ca newly dx, on heparin gtt for DVT, now with 
      new L sided weakness this morning.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      eval for stroke                                                                 
     No contraindications for IV contrast

                                     FINAL REPORT
     CT SCAN OF THE BRAIN:
     
     INDICATION:  Metastatic lung cancer on heparin for DVT.  Now with new left
     sided weakness.  Evaluate for stroke or hemorrhage.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial non-contrast CT scans of the brain were obtained.
     
     Comparison is made to the previous CT of [**2602-3-30**].  No detail is visible in the
     posterior fossa, however, the fourth ventricle is midline.  There is no gross
     shift of the posterior fossa structure.
     
     In the supratentorial space, there are hyperdense areas noted in the white
     matter of both frontal lobes and in the posterior periventricular white
     matter.  There are also right caudate nuclear infarctions.  These findings are
     stable compared to the previous study.  There is no definite evidence of gyral
     edema or loss of grey/white matter differentiation in arterial territory to
     indicate acute territorial infarction.  There is no hyperdensity within the
     brain or in the extra-axial space to indicate acute intracranial hemorrhage.
     
     The ventricles are not dilated.  There is no shift of midline structures.
     
     There are dense calcifications of the intracranial internal carotid arteries.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Limited examination due to patient motion.  There is no evidence
     of acute intracranial hemorrhage.  No territorial infarctions are identified.
     Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11326**] was informed of the findings at 10:15 am on [**2602-4-2**].  For further
     evaluation an MRI is recommended, if clinically indicated.
