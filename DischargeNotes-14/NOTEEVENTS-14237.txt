Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2446**] 
Chief Complaint:
Fever
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**3135-1-19**]: Chest Tube Placement
Tracheostomy

 
History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 50 year old female with multiple myeloma, s/p 
autologous stem cell transplant, transfusion dependent, 
presenting with fevers and upper respiratory congestion. The 
patient was in her usual state of health until two days prior to 
admission when she began sneezing. She came to the outpatient 
clinic for platelet and blood transfusions over the weekend. The 
night prior to admission, she developed a frontal headache, 
runny nose, nasal congestion, watery and red eyes and had 
difficulty sleeping. She presented for a scheduled visit at the 
clinic for platelet transfusion today.  She developed a 
temperature to 100.5 after one unit of blood transfusion.  She 
was also transfused one unit of platelets.  The patient was 
admitted for febrile neutropenia.  
 
Past Medical History:
Multiple Myeloma
-Diagnosed with IgG multiple myeloma in [**3121**].  She was followed 
expectantly with stable asymptomatic disease
-[**7-/3130**] she developed back pain, anemia and an IgG level to the 
mid 3000 range.  Bone marrow biopsy demonstrated approximately 
40-50% plasma cellularity.  MRI revealed an expansile lesion in 
the left iliac crest.  She was treated with pulse Decadron until 
[**8-/3130**] but developed hypercalcemia. 
-She received high-dose Cytoxan for stem cell priming.  On 
[**3131-1-23**], she underwent an autologous bone transplant and 
attained a CR.  
-[**12/3132**], she was noted to have a rising IgG level with 
progressive bone pain
-bone marrow biopsy performed in [**2-/3133**] showed 90% plasma cell 
cellularity with amyloidosis by [**Country **] red staining comprising 
approximately 40% of the marrow core.  
-[**3133-4-11**], she was started on protocol 04-130 with Velcade and 
Revamid--and completed 8 cycles.
-[**8-/3134**], found to have progressive disease by skeletal survey. 
She was restarted on Velcade/Revlamid to cytoreduce prior to 
allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
-[**10-29**], secondary to poor response to therapy, changed to 
Melphalan, Revlamid, Prednisone

 
Social History:
Lives with husband and two children (daughter, 14 y/o, and son, 
16y/o).  Denies significant tobacco use - smoked about [**12-25**] ppd 
x2-3 years, quit 20y ago.  Occasional alcohol, no IVDU.  Does 
not work outside the home.

 
Family History:

.
[**11-13**]: CT sinus-IMPRESSION:
1. Mucosal thickening of the paranasal sinuses as described 
above.
2. Preseptal periorbital soft tissue edema and postseptal 
extraconal fat stranding, most consistent with a cellulitis.
.
[**11-14**]: MR head/brain: IMPRESSION:
1. Features consistent with invasive fungal sinusitis involving 
primarily the bilateral ethmoid sinuses and the nasal cavity, 
which are filled with presumably necrotic non-enhancing 
material, and extension into and post- septal involvement of the 
medial aspect of the right orbit.
2. Possible transgression of the cribriform plates with evidence 
of reactive pachymeningeal enhancement in bifrontal regions.
3. Mucosal thickening in sphenoid sinus and right maxillary 
fluid, with no definite direct extension of the ethmoid process.
4. No foci of abnormal enhancement noted in the brain.
5. Unremarkable cranial MRA. 
.
[**11-18**]: MR orbit: CONCLUSION: Findings of some concern for 
progression of fungal infection with secondary mucosal 
abnormalities as noted above.
.
[**11-20**] CT sinus: IMPRESSION: Extensive sinus disease with 
increased density consistent with the history of fungal 
sinusitis.
.
[**12-11**] CT sinus: IMPRESSION: Persistent opacification of multiple 
paranasal sinuses with worsening of opacity within the sphenoid 
sinus. Although no definite bony erosion is identified, 
increased subcutaneous air as well as air adjacent to the lamina 
papyracea on the left raises the question of breach of this 
structure, as well as transmission of infection via emissary 
veins, the latter mechanism being invoked to account for the 
tiny amount of left extraconal gas adjacent to the left lamina 
papyracea.
.
[**3135-1-13**] CT sinus: IMPRESSION: Minimally increased aeration of 
the paranasal sinuses since the prior of [**3134-12-11**]. No 
definite osseous erosions are present. The subcutaneous air 
within the left nasolacrimal duct persists. Please correlate 
clinically.
.
[**1-16**] MR head/orbit: IMPRESSION:
1. There is marked distention of the left nasolacrimal duct 
suggesting distal obstruction. Currently, it is distended with 
fluid. Previously it was air filled.
2. There is extensive opacification of the paranasal sinuses 
with minimal aeration of the sphenoid sinus, the maxillary 
sinuses, and up to the ethmoid air cells as seen on the CT from 
[**1-2**]. The left maxillary sinus air-fluid level is no longer 
seen.
3. There is bilateral periosteal-based enhancement at the 
lateral aspect of the lamina papyracea both pre-septal and 
post-septal, unchanged from [**11-18**] and likely related to the 
fungal infection.
4. The diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement seen previously has 
improved.
5. The visualized marrow signal intensity is more abnormal than 
previously, perhaps related to progression of the patient's 
myeloma, perhaps related to marrow proliferation secondary to 
infection.
.
[**1-19**] CT chest: IMPRESSION: 
1. Large layering right-sided pleural effusion with associated 
compressive atelectasis/ collapse of a large part of the right 
lower lobe, and portions of the right middle lobe and right 
upper lobe. There are high-density areas within this pleural 
effusion dependently concerning for hematoma.
2. Multiple bilateral patchy focal opacities in the lungs with 
associated ground-glass opacity consistent with an 
infectious/inflammatory process. Follow-up is recommended to 
demonstrate resolution.
3. Probable splenomegaly.
4. Small pericardial effusion.
5. Diffuse osseous abnormality consistent with multiple myeloma.
.
[**1-20**] CT chest: IMPRESSION:
1. Decrease in size of large right-sided pleural effusion with 
improvement in previously noted atelectasis and collapse. Again 
high-density area within this pleural effusion is concerning for 
hematoma.
2. New right-sided pleural drainage tube with small right apical 
pneumothorax.
3. Multiple patchy focal opacities within the lungs are again 
identified, likely consistent with an infectious/inflammatory 
process. Followup is again recommended to ensure resolution.
4. Diffuse osseous abnormality consistent with multiple myeloma.
.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
50 year old female with relapsed Stage 3A IgG kappa multiple 
myeloma, presented with neutropenic fever, hospital course 
complicated by GI bleed, invasive fungal sinusitis, and transfer 
to the FICU for pleural effusion/hemothorax then underwent an 
allo-BMT [**3135-1-29**].  Thereafter she had a PEA cardiac arrest and 
was transferred to the ICU-east.  Hospital course organized by 
ICU-East events then summary of prolonged hospital course:
.
# Invasive fungal sinusitis: The patient's upper respiratory 
symptoms rapidly progressed to right eye swelling and 
discoloration. ENT evaluation revealed necrotic turbinate and 
microbiology and pathology preliminary evaluations demonstrated 
hyphae.  She was started on high dose Ambisome and posaconazole 
for invasive fungal sinusitis. Risk factors for this condition 
include prolonged neutropenia,  steroid-induced hyperglycemia 
and history of multiple transfusions.  She was also changed  
briefly to GM-CSF bid in an effort to improve killing of 
zygomycetes. A sinus CT on [**12-11**] showed worsening disease. After 
that, pt seemed to stabilize until mid-January, when pt began to 
develop worsening swelling around medial epicanthal disease. 
Serial CT sinus and MRI orbit/head showed continued sinus 
infection, but no significant bony erosion on posaconazole and 
ambisome combination therapy.
.
# Multiple myeloma: The patient's most recent regimen was 
Melphelan, Revlamid and Prednisone. She was tapered off the 
Prednisone and her Revlamid was held. She continued to be 
neutropenic, and was continued on GM-CSF.  She was platelet 
transfusion dependent. Last bone marrow showed 95-100% plasma 
cells with amyloid.  Given one dose IVIG. On [**11-22**] she was 
started on cytoxan/prednisone chemotherapy. She remained 
pan-cytopenic after therapy and continued to be transfusion 
dependant. Neupogen and epogen did little to increase her 
counts. On [**3134-12-12**] she was started on Doxil/velcade therapy as 
she has not received doxil previously. On [**3134-12-28**], pt remained 
neutropenic on G-CSF, repeat bone marrow biopsy done, appears 
that marrow remains fibrotic with collagen deposition, not 
nearly as cellular as previous marrow. Decided to proceed 
forward with bone marrow transplant anticipating brother's 
arrival [**3135-1-16**]. On [**1-16**]- repeat MRI sinus/orbit with marked 
distention of L nasolacrimal duct and continued extensive sinus 
disease, but no extensive bony erosion, pt decided to continue 
with BMT. However, in prep for BMT on [**3135-1-19**], pt developed 
hemothorax [**1-25**] right sublavian central line placement and was 
sent to the FICU ([**1-20**]).  This resolved and she successfully 
underwent BMT on [**3135-1-29**].  Continued cyclosporine for GVH ppx
.
#. Respiratory failure. Increased work of breathing led to 
re-intubation. Largest contributor was pneumonia. Also could be 
chest wall weight given edema, ? aspiration due to vomiting. 
underwent tracheostomy on [**3-18**]. 
.  
# Pseudomonal pneumonia: Had pseudomonas on sputum culture from 
[**3-9**]. Sensitivities indicated resistance to meropenem and cipro. 
continued on ceftaz and tobramycin. tobra was dosed by level. 
.  
#. Enterococcal and coag-neg staph bacteremia. Blood cultures 
positive from [**3-5**] showing enterococcus sensitive to vancomycin. 
Has since had lines changed (new R IJ; R SC, R a line, L PICC 
d/c'd on [**3-7**]). Cath tip from A line grew coag negative staph 
but PICC/CVL cath tip cultures negative. Continued vancomycin. 
Dose by vanc troughs (goal 15-20)  
.  
#. Altered MS: Previous work-up negative, including MRI with no 
parenchymal involvement of mucor, HSV-6 negative, HSV 1,2 
negative from CSF. Head CT [**2-18**] negative. EEG with diffuse 
encephalopathy, no epileptiform features.  Continued supportive 
care  
.  
#. Renal Failure: Potentially due to over-diuresis but patient 
is grossly edematous and total body overloaded. Previous meds 
thought to potentially be related are gancyclovir and acyclovir 
which were d/c'd without much improvement.  Continued 
cyclosporin gtt (dosed by level as tends to be renal toxic). 
other meds too were renally dosed.  
.  
#. Hypercalcemia:Possibly related to malignancy versus 
medication additions versus side effect of renal failure. 
Calcium slowly improved. Gave pamidronate 60 mg IV X 1 on [**2-28**], 
usually dosed monthly  
.  
#. Hyperphosphatemia: resolved. Continued sevelamer. Likely 
secondary to renal insufficiency.  
.  
#. Pancytopenia: counts improved after restarting GCSF. 
Discontinued acyclovir/ aztreonam as dropping counts may have 
been related to meds. Continued to transfuse for HCT >25, PLT 
>10. Transfused Plt>50 for active bleeding.  
.  
# Cardiac Arrest [**2-18**]: PEA vs asystole. Most likely due to 
hypoxia due to supraglottis/vocal cord occlusion from black 
debris/clots as noted by anesthesia during intubation vs 
worsening CHF. No h/o CAD to suggest ACS. Difficult to determine 
the length of her arrest; was found asystolic with return of 
rhythm in 3 minutes, but unknown how long she was down prior to 
that. Initial concerns of anoxic brain injury were alleviated 
when her mental status improved significantly - she was awake 
and alert and conversing, albeit slowly.  
.  
# Leg blisters: Has blistering along inner thighs bilaterally. 
Improved. Etiology unclear-potentially contact from foley tape? 
On zinc/vitamin C for wound healing. 
.  
# Hyperglycemia: Continued ISS, titrated to goal 80-150  
.  
# FEN: TPN. Replete lytes prn.  
.
# PPX: PPI, no heparin as plts are low, hold bowel regimen for 
now as some diarrhea, pneumoboots.  
.
# Code: DNR/I

     INDICATION:  Female with multiple myeloma, admitted with neutropenic fever.
     Found to have invasive fungal sinusitis.  Improving clinically since [**3134-12-11**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  A noncontrast paranasal sinus CT was performed.
     
     FINDINGS:  Compared to the prior examination of [**3134-12-11**], there has
     been minimal improvement.  There is slight improvement in the amount of
     opacification of the right maxillary sinus.  However, majority of the
     maxillary sinus remains opacified.  The extensive mucosal thickening and small
     air fluid level within the left maxillary sinus appears approximately
     unchanged.  However, there appears to be minimally improved aeration of the
     ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses.  Areas of extensive mucosal thickening remain.
     The frontal sinuses remain completely opacified.
     
     No osseous erosions are present.  The increased air within the left
     nasolacrimal duct remains present.  The extraconal air along the lamina
     papyracea has resolved.  In addition, there is lucency within the left pedicle
     and near the facet of the C3 vertebral body.  This could also represent a
     focus of multiple myeloma.  An additional lucent focus is also noted in the
     right lamina of C3.  These areas were not previously imaged.
     
     The mastoid air cells are well pneumatized.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Minimally increased aeration of the paranasal sinuses since the
     prior of [**3134-12-11**].  No definite osseous erosions are present.  The
     subcutaneous air within the left nasolacrimal duct persists.  Please correlate
     clinically.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     MRI OF THE BRAIN AND ORBITS
     
     CLINICAL HISTORY:  Multiple myeloma.  Fungus infection.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar pre- and post-contrast T1-weighted images, T2-
     weighted, susceptibility, FLAIR and diffusion-weighted images were obtained.
     
     FINDINGS:
     The brain parenchyma remains normal.  The ventricles, cisterns and sulci are
     normal.  The marrow signal intensity in the skull base in the visualized
     cervical vertebra is diffusely abnormally T1 hypointense.  Previously some
     upper cervical normal fatty marrow was visualized.  This is a nonspecific
     finding but could be related to progression of the patient's myeloma.  It can
     also be seen in systemic infection.  The calvarial marrow remains normal.  The
     pachymeningeal enhancement seen in November has improved/nearly resolved. Some
     dural thickening is evident nonetheless.
     
     As seen on the multiple prior CT and MRIs, there is total opacification of the
     left maxillary sinus by a combination of enhancing soft tissue and T2
     hyperintense nonenhancing fluid.  There is near-total opacification of the
     right maxillary sinus.  The ethmoid air cells are opacified primarily by
     enhancing soft tissue with a few areas of central aeration as seen on the CT.
     There is subtotal opacification of the sphenoid sinus.  The frontal sinuses
     are completely opacified as seen on the CT from [**1-2**]. There is peripheral
     enhancing soft tissue and central T2 hyperintense fluid.
     
     As seen on the MRI study from [**3134-11-18**], there is thick enhancing soft tissue
     lateral to the lamina papyracea, bilaterally, in the anterior orbits, medial
     to the medial rectus muscles.  This periosteal-based thickening and
     enhancement is worse on the right than the left and approximately stable
     compared to [**11-18**].  The left lacrimal duct is markedly enlarged and currently
     fluid filled.  It was distended by air previously.  The side of the medial
     canthus abnormality is not indicated but this would affect the medial canthus.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  There is marked distention of the left nasolacrimal duct suggesting distal
     obstruction.  Currently, it is distended with fluid.  Previously it was air
     filled.
     2.  There is extensive opacification of the paranasal sinuses with minimal
     aeration of the sphenoid sinus, the maxillary sinuses, and up to the ethmoid
                                                                 (Over)

     level is no longer seen.
     3.  There is bilateral periosteal-based enhancement at the lateral aspect of
     the lamina papyracea both pre-septal and post-septal, unchanged from [**11-18**] and
     likely related to the fungal infection.
     4.  The diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement seen previously has improved.
     5.  The visualized marrow signal intensity is more abnormal than previously,
     perhaps related to progression of the patient's myeloma, perhaps related to
     marrow proliferation secondary to infection.

     INDICATION:  History of multiple myeloma, transfusion dependent, in
     preparation for bone marrow transplant.  Had central line placed yesterday
     with dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain.  Also had concomitant hematocrit drop.
     Please evaluate for effusion, infiltrate, or hemothorax.  A discussion with
     Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7645**] indicates a strong clinical suspicion for hemothorax.
     
     COMPARISON:  Radiograph dated [**3135-1-18**] and [**3135-1-19**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast chest CT. (IV contrast was not administered due to
     history of multiple myeloma)
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is a large layering right-sided
     pleural effusion.  There is collapse of a large portion of the right lower
     lobe, part of the right middle lobe, and the posterior aspects of the right
     upper lobe, presumably secondary to the large pleural effusion.  No obvious
     central obstructing mass is seen, though evaluation is limited without IV
     contrast.  Portions of this large pleural effusion contain plate-like areas of
     increased density within that are consistent with atelectatic/compressed lung.
     At the right lung base, in the most dependent aspects of the hemithorax, there
     is high-density material with Hounsfield unit attenuation value of 60 to 67
     that is concerning for hematoma.  There are multiple small areas of patchy
     opacity with associated ground-glass opacity in the left upper lobe, right
     upper lobe, and left lower lobes consistent with an infectious/inflammatory
     process.  There is a small pericardial effusion.  There is left-sided PICC
     catheter, and a right-sided subclavian line.  There is no evidence of
     mediastinal hematoma.  The great vessels are visualized, however patency
     cannot be evaluated without IV contrast.
     
     Limited images of the upper abdomen demonstrate atherosclerotic calcification
     of the aorta and splenomegaly.
     
     Bone windows demonstrate diffuse osseous abnormality consistent with patient's
     history of multiple myeloma.
     
     IMPRESSION:  
     1.  Large layering right-sided pleural effusion with associated compressive
     atelectasis/ collapse of a large part of the right lower lobe, and portions of
     the right middle lobe and right upper lobe.  There are high-density areas
     within this pleural effusion dependently concerning for hematoma.

     FINDINGS:
     
     The right hemidiaphragm is more elevated, and I suspect some accumulation of a

     could be atelectasis or pneumonia.  That does not appear significantly
     different.  Tip of the right CVL remains in place and the tip of the left PICC
     line may be extending into the right atrium.  This is not clearly visualized.
     
     There is no pneumothorax.

     right lower lung zone airspace disease.

     INDICATION:  History of multiple myeloma, for reevaluation of hemothorax.
     
     COMPARISON:  CT chest [**3135-1-19**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast axial CT images of the chest were obtained with
     multiplanar reformatted images.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There has been decrease in size of a
     previously noted large layering right-sided pleural effusion.  In addition,
     there has been some reexpansion in the previously noted collapse of the
     posterior aspect of the right upper lobe and right middle lobe with some
     continued collapse noted in a large portion of the right lower lobe likely
     secondary to large effusion.  Again no obvious central obstructing mass is
     seen, though evaluation is limited without IV contrast.  Dependent portion of
     this fluid collection is of high density measuring approximately 74 Hounsfield
     units, again concerning for hematoma.  Previously noted small areas of patchy
     opacity are again noted in the left upper and right upper lobes, likely
     consistent with an infectious/inflammatory process.  There is a new small
     left-sided pleural effusion as well as increased consolidation/atelectasis at
     the left lung base.
     
     A right-sided chest tube has been placed and there is a new small right apical
     pneumothorax.  Other smaller collections of pleural air are noted along the
     lateral aspect of the right lung.
     
     Left-sided PICC and right-sided subclavian lines are again seen.  A small
     pericardial effusion is again noted.  The great vessels are unremarkable on
     this unenhanced scan.  Limited evaluation of the upper abdomen again suggests
     mild splenomegaly.
     
     Bone windows again reveal diffuse osseous abnormality consistent with
     patient's history of multiple myeloma.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Decrease in size of large right-sided pleural effusion with improvement in
     previously noted atelectasis and collapse.  Again high-density area within
     this pleural effusion is concerning for hematoma.
     2.  New right-sided pleural drainage tube with small right apical
                                                                 (Over)

     3.  Multiple patchy focal opacities within the lungs are again identified,

     HISTORY:  Right pneumothorax after subclavian line placement.
     
     IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**1-21**] through 30:
     
     Moderate-sized right pneumothorax, primarily apical, is unchanged in size
     since [**1-22**] at 8:29 p.m. following removal of right basal pleural tube.
     The apical pleural line is at the level of the fourth posterior interspace,
     and there is a smaller amount of air along with diaphragmatic and lateral
     costal pleural surfaces.  Slight leftward shift of the lower mediastinum has
     been a constant feature since at least [**3135-1-10**], before the right
     pneumothorax, and is not an indication in and of itself of right pleural
     contents under tension.  The right hemidiaphragm is normal in contour and
     remains higher than the left.  Left lung is clear.  The right shows mild basal
     atelectasis.  Tip of the left PIC catheter ends alongside the right subclavian
     line in mid SVC.  Heart size top normal, unchanged.

     HISTORY:  Right pneumothorax after subclavian line placement.  Chest tube
     removed.
     
     IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**1-24**] and 2:
     
     No appreciable right pneumothorax.  Moderate right pleural effusion stable.
     Moderate cardiomegaly worsened.  New 2.5 cm wide nodular opacity projecting
     over the right third anterior rib could be a small fissural pleural fluid
     collection, or a new lung nodule, presumably infectious.  Careful followup
     advised.  Tip of the right subclavian line projects over the upper SVC.  The
     tip of the left PIC catheter can be traced only as far as the periphery of the
     left brachiocephalic vein.
     
     I discussed these findings over the telephone with the house officer covering

     FINDINGS:  Compared with [**3135-1-28**], there is increase in the right lower lobe
     collapse/consolidation.  The size of the right pleural effusion may have
     increased slightly, but the current lordotic projection makes this difficult
     to say with certainty.  The right upper and left lung fields are clear.
     
     The ovoid density previously noted in the lateral aspect of the right mid lung
     field is seen to represent loculated fluid within the minor fissure.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Increased right lower lobe collapse/consolidation.

     No prior examinations.
     
     TWO VIEWS THE ABDOMEN:  No evidence of free air under the hemidiaphragms.
     Limited views of the lung bases demonstrate a large right-sided pleural
     effusion with atelectasis as well as a loculated aspect of the effusion. There
     is prominence of the hepatic and splenic shadows, suggestive of
     hepatosplenomegaly.  The small bowel loops are not visualized which may be due
     to fluid filling.  Contrast is seen within the transverse colon, likely
     retained from upper GI series performed on [**3135-1-15**].  Scattered air and stool
     is seen within the distal transverse colon and splenic flexure.  Osseous
     structures and soft tissues are unremarkable.  A phlebolith is noted in the
     right hemipelvis.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Relatively gasless abdomen which may indicate fluid in the small

     There is again seen bilateral pleural effusions, right side much greater than
     left.  There is pulmonary vascular congestion which is unchanged.  There is a
     lobulated infiltrate in the right upper lobe which has developed since
     [**3135-2-1**].  A central venous catheter with distal tip in the SVC is
     again seen.  There is also a PICC line from the left side with distal tip in
     the mid SVC.  No pneumothoraces are identified.

     INDICATION:  Multiple myeloma, now with abdominal distention and pain.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT was used to obtain contiguous axial images from the lung
     bases to the pubic symphysis after uneventful administration of oral and
     Optiray IV contrast.  Please note that there is considerable motion artifact
     from breathing.  The referring physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 527**] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 7681**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7682**], was asked to hydrate
     the patient in order to prophylax against renal failure. No prior studies are
     available for comparison.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  Catheter in right atrium.  There are bilateral
     pleural effusions. The left pleural effusion is small.  The right pleural
     effusions are large, with several loculations, the largest in the subpulmonic
     region under the right middle lobe, with a smaller component in the anterior
     right subpulmonic region.  Atelectasis is seen in the left lung base.  There
     is a small pericardial effusion.  The liver, gallbladder, adrenals, and
     kidneys are within normal limits on this somewhat-motion-limited exam. The
     spleen is enlarged.  Pancreas, stomach, and small bowel loops are within
     normal limits. There is no free fluid or free air.  No lymphadenopathy is
     identified.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The cecum is flipped medially.  There are focal
     areas of wall thickening in the distal left colon, rectum, and rectosigmoid
     junction.  There is a small amount of stranding seen in the fat surrounding
     the rectosigmoid junction.  Mild heterogeneity is seen in the distal rectum.
     No free fluid or free air is seen.  There is no lymphadenopathy; a calcified
     mesenteric lymph node is seen.
     
     Bone windows show diffuse sclerotic and lytic foci throughout the appendicular
     and axial skeleton.  No fractures are identified.
     
     Multiplanar reformats were essential in delineating the findings above.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Segments of wall thickening and very mild stranding surrounding portions
     of the distal colon.  On CT it is difficult to differentiate between
     peristalsis and thickening; followup imaging or colonoscopy is recommended for
     further evaluation.

     frequent infection.  Mental status changes.  Evaluate for interval change in
     lesions invasion.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted sequences were obtained through
     the brain.  Limited thin slice images were also obtained through the
     nasopharynx.  No post-gadolinium imaging was provided, and the pre-gadolinium

     FINDINGS:  As noted on prior examinations, there is pansinusitis.  It appears
     slightly improved from the prior examination of [**3135-1-16**], as there is
     increased aeration of the right maxillary sinus.  The extraconal fat has

     and effusion and fluid overload.
     
     Comparison is made with prior study dated [**3135-1-20**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT through the chest without IV contrast.  5, 1.25-
     mm collimation images and coronal reformations were reviewed.
     
     FINDINGS:  Narrowing/impaction in the right lower lobe bronchus is associated
     with distal consolidation/atelectasis.  Otherwise the lungs are clear.  Smooth
     thickening of the interlobular septae with focal areas of ground-glass opacity
     throughout the lungs is consistent with mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
     Mild area of atelectasis in the right apex is new, is adjacent to a loculated
     plaural fluid in the paramediastinal pleura (3:10).  Focal area of
     consolidation in the left upper lobe (3:28) is unchanged.  Multiple areas of
     consolidation in the left lower lobe have improved, for example in the most
     distal left lower lobe (3:41).  Small right pneumothorax is resolved.  There
     has been interval increase in the amount of moderate-sized right pleural
     effusion with apparent loculations in the major and minor fissure as in the
     apical right paramediastinal area. Small pericardial effusion is unchanged.
     Small left pleural effusion is new. There is stranding of the mediastinal fat,
     mediastinal/paratracheal lymph node do not meet CT criteria for pathology.
     
     Bone windows show osseous abnormality consistent with patient's history of
     multiple myeloma.
     
     Right subclavian vein catheter and left PICC line tip are in the SVC and right
     atrium respectively.
     
     In the upper abdomen, splenomegaly is unchanged.

     FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to previous study from [**3135-2-8**].
     
     The right-sided central venous catheter is unchanged.  There is a left-sided
     PICC line in the proximal RA, which is also unchanged.  The cardiac silhouette
     is enlarged.  There is again noted diffuse airspace opacities throughout both

     INDICATION:  Rising bilirubin and liver function tests with hypoxia, status
     post cardiac arrest with worsening abdominal pain.
     
     LIMITED ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND, PORTABLE:  Examination is limited secondary to
     patient's inability to follow commands as she is intubated.  Comparison is
     made to the prior exam from six days earlier.  The liver is normal in
     echotexture.  No focal liver masses or intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation
     is identified.  The portal vein is patent and demonstrates normal hepatopetal
     flow.  The IVC and hepatic veins are patent.  The gallbladder, although not
     distended, demonstrates a markedly thickened wall measuring up to 7 mm.  Again
     seen is layering sludge.  Limited examination of the four abdominal quadrants
     shows a small amount of ascites in the left lower quadrant.  The spleen is
     markedly enlarged.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  New diffuse gallbladder wall edema with a small amount of gallbladder
     sludge without gallbladder distension.  This finding could be due to a
     systemic abnormality such as liver dysfunction, heart failure, or kidney
     failure as well as hypoalbuminemia or hypoproteinemia.  Alternatively acute or
     chronic cholecystitis are considerations however these entities would be less
     likely given the lack of gallbladder distension.  Close followup is
     recommended.
     2.  No evidence for biliary ductal dilatation.
     3.  Patent portal vein, hepatic veins, and IVC without evidence for [**Last Name (un) **]-
     occlusive disease.
     4.  Small ascites in the left lower quadrant.
     5.  Splenomegaly, better evaluated on the CT abdomen/pelvis of [**3135-2-2**].

     AP CHEST, 5:53 A.M., [**2-13**]
     
     HISTORY:  Following intubation.
     
     IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**2-10**] through 20:
     
     Tip of the endotracheal tube is still above the upper margin of the clavicles
     more than the 54 mm measured electronically from the carina due to kyphotic
     positioning.  I discussed the high placement of the endotracheal tube with the
     house officer caring for this patient yesterday.  It may have been advanced in
     the interim since the chin was down on yesterday's film and is elevated today.
     Tube should be advanced 3 cm:
     
     Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema has improved, but moderate right pleural
     effusion and bibasilar consolidation worse on the left are unchanged.  No
     pneumothorax.
     
     Tip of right subclavian line projects over the upper SVC while a left PICC
     line can be traced as far as the superior cavoatrial junction.  Nasogastric
     tube passes into the stomach and out of view.  No pneumothorax or
     pneumoperitoneum.

     subclavian central line is present, tip over proximal SVC.
     
     Cardiomediastinal silhouette is slightly prominent, but likely accentuated by

Events: Pt's HR was increased very high with short runs of like V-Tach rythm occasionally, at the beginning pt responded to suctioning 2-3 times each time, however frequency of tachycardia increased drastically, intern ([**Doctor Last Name 19**]) informed, given Lopressor and Lopressor Po was changed from 5 mp BiD to 5 mg TiD, Then BP started  occasionally dropping down to SBP 40s and then pumping up to MAP above 60, intern observed that and the plan of starting Dilt drip as he thought could help controlling the HR was changed due to occasional hypotensive episodes. EKG taken 2X, by that time ventilator was changed bt respiratory therapist to CPAP, PS, VBGs sent PH 7.19. Then at around 0300 BP dropped to 40s and HR also dropped to 40s, intern and informed, then resident assessed patient and ordered Dopamine drip at 5 mcg/kg/min, 5-10 minutes after Dopamine started HR increased from 40s to 180s as a reflexive tachycardia, Dopamine stopped. About 3 L of fluid boluses were given, Levophed ordered but was not started as BP improved in response to fluids. HR dropped again and 5 mg Glucagon IV was ordered to revert action of lopressor; however, glucagon was not given as HR improved automatically. Then Dopamine was started at 2 mcg/kg/min because BP dropped again in spite of fluid boluses. Pt was put back on AC. Pt was transfused with 1 unit of platelet which did not change the plt count that was checked after i hr, then at about 0400 transfused with a second unit of platelet as plt count dropped to 14.

     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT acquired axial images were obtained through the head without
     intravenous contrast.
     
     CT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST.
     
     There is no evidence of acute parenchymal mass lesion, hydrocephalus, shift of
     normal midline structures, or major vascular territorial infarct.  The density
     values of the brain parenchyma are within normal limits.  No areas of
     hemorrhage are identified.  There is stable appearance to opacification within
     the maxillary and ethmoid air cells with interval increase in opacification
     within the sphenoid sinuses and mastoid air cells bilaterally likely related
     to progression of patient's known mucormycosis infection.  No definite new
     osseous erosions are apparent.

     CHEST, ONE VIEW:  Comparison with [**3135-2-17**].  The endotracheal tube is
     4 cm above the carina.  The right subclavian central venous catheter
     terminates in the SVC.  The left-sided PICC line terminates in the region of
     the right atrium.  The NG tube extends below the hemidiaphragm, off the
     confines of the image.  There is slightly worse bilateral patchy airspace
     opacities as well as an increased consolidation in the left retrocardiac
     region.  There is no pneumothorax.  The heart is borderline in size.  There is
     pulmonary vascular redistribution.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Worsening of bilateral airspace opacities, which could represent an
     infectious process versus pulmonary edema.
     
     2.  Left-sided PICC line appears to be within the right atrium.  This was
     discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] at 12:00 p.m. on [**3135-2-18**].

     AP CHEST, 5:05 A.M., [**3-3**]
     
     HISTORY:  Multiple myeloma and cardiac arrest.  Worsening infiltrates.
     
     IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**2-27**] through 10:
     
     Multifocal pneumonia is unchanged since [**2-27**].  Moderate enlargement of the
     cardiac silhouette is stable and the distention of mediastinal veins suggest
     some elevation of central venous pressure increased slightly since [**3-1**]. 
     Tip of the endotracheal tube is at the sternal notch, in standard placement
     and a nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view.  Right
     subclavian line tip projects over the junction of the brachiocephalic veins. 
     No pneumothorax.

resp:  present vent settings of 40% 10 peep 5 pressure support with spont tvs of 407-530 and resp rate of 13-22---sats of 99-100%. suctioning pt for bloody thick sputum, but trying to minimize the suctioning.  lung sounds are coarse. intermittently pt will become bronchospastic, but would settle out without intervention.  rotated and retaped the ettube.  surgery up to consult on pt---surgeon spoke with pt and pt alert and nodded to questions asked of her by surgeon and then the surgeon spoke with husband, [**Doctor Last Name **]. surgery will most likely NOT be tomorrow.

cardiac:  bp of 137-160/73-85 with a pulse of 60-65 sr.  at approx 10:30a, after pt vomited, pt had a 13 beat run of v-tach and then another smaller episode of v-tach---both resolving without intervention.  K+ was 4.0.  na was 146. restarted  hydralazine.  dc'd lasix.  

id:  neutropenic precautions.  temps of 98.1 ax, 97.1 ax, 97.5 po.  cyclosporine infusing at 162mg/day.  ambisome started and the posaconazole was dc'd--??? whether pt was absorbing po meds, especially with the vomiting.  sputum on [**3-2**] was 2+ gpc in pairs, chains and clusters. and 2+ gpr. urine was neg. blood cxs are pending.

gi:  abdomin has been slightly more firm/distended this after noon., with hypoactive bowel sounds.  pt vomited a large amt of bilish vomitus, with pill fragments noted, this morning---question whether pt is absorbing po meds. when meds were given at 8a, there were only a minimal amt of residuals obtained--ph [**2-24**] and ob +.  .5mg of ativan given after vomiting for nausea.  tpn is infusing at 44.5cc/hr.  

gu:  foley in place.  urine output approx 80-100cc/hr.  added a small amt of water to balloon as there was some urine incontence noted on pink pad.  bun 113 and creat 1.3. holding lasix now that pt is on ambisome due to possiblity of bun and creat becoming elevated.

neuro:  pt more somulent this shift--only small amt of interaction with nurse and husband.  although, pt was very awake when surgeon was speaking with and to her and appeared to be nodding appropriately when asked if she wanted this surgery done. doesn't really follow simple commands on a regular basis.

endo:  fingerstick at 2p was 206 and pt rec'd 4u humalog.  fs at 6p was 214.

     INDICATION:  51-year-old with relapsed multiple myeloma, sinusitis, minimally
     responsive on CsA.  Please evaluate for parenchymal lesions, CSA toxicity,
     cavernous sinus thrombosis, or progression of sinusitis.
     
     COMPARISONS:  CT brain of [**3135-2-18**] and MR brain of [**3135-2-4**].
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images through the brain with
     additional gadolinium-enhanced diffusion-weighted sequences and 3D time-of-
     flight imaging through the dural venous sinuses.
     
     MR [**First Name (Titles) 2197**] [**Last Name (Titles) 2198**]:  There is extensive pansinusitis, without demonstrable
     intraparenchymal extent, nor osseous destruction.  The right frontal sinus is
     completely opacified.  There are air-fluid levels in the sphenoid sinuses. The
     left maxillary sinus has prominent mucosal thickening and the right maxillary
     sinus, more mild mucosal thickening.  The ethmoid air cells are opacified
     bilaterally.  No signal abnormalities within the brain parenchyma.  No
     restricted diffusion indicating infarction or susceptibility artifact to
     indicate hemorrhage.  The mastoid processes are opacified bilaterally.  No
     abnormal enhancement in the brain parenchyma.  Note is made of diffuse
     thickening of the dura, a nonspecific finding.
     
     MRV FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of dural venous thrombosis.  Multiplanar
     reformatted images confirm this.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) Extensive pansinusitis and mastoid opacification as above, without evidence
     of intraparenchymal extension or definite osseous destruction.
     2) No evidence of sinus venous thrombosis.
     3) No intraparenchymal abnormalities detected.
     4) Diffusely heterogeneous calvarium, presumably related to the patient's
     known multiple myeloma.
     5) Diffuse thickening of the dura, a nonspecific finding which may relate to
     inflammation, prior lumbar puncture, or less likely infection.  The thickening
     is not significantly worse near the sinuses and appears to have been present

Neuro:  Pt appears to understand, nodding her head to questions but only intermittantly following commands.  She was given 2 mg of versed prior to going down for an attempted trache and an additional 2 mg for the MRI as well as .25 mcg of fent for the MRI too.  She is somewhat sedated this afternoon after returning from MRI, she is responsive to pain but her eyes are not open and looking around now.  The MRI of her head per verbal report does not look significantly differant than her last one - the final read is pending.

CV:  Her BP has been stable though she did drop to the 90s when she was in MRI, HR has been in the 60s-70s, tolerating the hydralazine and lopressor.

Resp:  She remains on the vent, she was heading down to the OR for the trache when the proceedure was cancelled due to an emergency in the OR, they will try again tomorrow.

GI:  She remains on TPN due to her past high residuals with the tube feeding, no stool today.  Pt to be given tylenol and then to have a tylenol level drawn tp see how well her gut is absorbing medication.  If she has a good absorption rate than she will be given PO antifungals.

     INDICATION:  51-year-old woman with multiple myeloma status post allographic
     transplant and with invasive mucor sinusitis and now with Pseudomonas in
     sputum, evaluate for pneumonia.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3135-2-5**] and [**3135-1-20**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT images were obtained of the chest extending from the thoracic
     inlet to the upper abdomen.  No intravenous contrast was administered.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Soft tissue window images demonstrate an
     ET tube, with the tip in the lower trachea.  There is slight overdistention of
     the cuff.  There is an NG tube in the esophagus.  There is a central line,
     with the tip in the mid SVC.
     
     There are bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than the left. These have
     increased in comparison to prior study, and the right pleural effusion
     demonstrates areas of loculation.  There is a new moderate-sized pericardial
     effusion.  There is evidence of anemia.
     
     There are new multifocal, bilateral confluent opacities, greatest in the left
     upper and left lower lobes. Additionally, there are several prominent
     prevascular lymph nodes, which are likely related to this infectious process.
     There is minimal septal thickening at the lung bases, though this has
     decreased in comparison to prior study.
     
     There is increased density within the liver parenchyma, suggesting iron
     deposition, likely related to multiple prior transfusions.  There is stable
     splenomegaly.  There is small amount of new perisplenic ascitic fluid.  There
     is anasarca within the lateral abdominal walls.
     
     Multiple well marginated lesions are seen throughout the vertebral bodies and
     within the right humeral head, findings which are consistent with areas of
     abnormality related to the patient's known multiple myeloma.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  New bilateral areas of multifocal confluent opacity, most consolidative
     within the left upper and lower lobes, consistent with multifocal pneumonia,
     likely related to the patient's known Pseudomonas.
     2.  Multiple lines and tubes as described above.  The cuff of the ET tube

     FINDINGS:  A single portable AP view of the chest was obtained.  There is an
     endotracheal tube with its tip 5.8 cm above the carina.  The distal end of a
     right IJ tube is again seen with its tip overlying the brachiocephalic,
     unchanged in position.  There is a nasogastric tube that extends below the
     diaphragm with its distal end excluded by the inferior margin of the film.
     
     There is extensive, bilateral alveolar air space disease with relative sparing
     of the left apex.  There are bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than
     right.  The overall appearance is essentially unchanged.  No evidence of
     pneumothorax.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Severe, diffuse bilateral airspace disease, without significant
     interval change.  Bilateral pleural effusions.

Review of Systems:

Neuro:  Sedated on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] (sluggish), unable to track or follow commands. 

CV: NSR w/ increasing ventricular ectopy throughout shift (ectopy frequency significantly inc. since levo restarted).  Anasarca, Afebrile, please refer to flowsheet for greater detail.

Resp:  See above for most recent ABG, pt RR remained 40-50 throughout shift. Current vent settings CPAP PS 30 FIO2 65%, sats 95-100% LS coarse throughout, lavaged for min thick blood tinged secretions.

GU/GI: BS absent, abd firm distended, TPN @ goal, Foley irrigation clamped @ 0400 to better evaluate actual U/[**Name Initial (MD) **] [**Name8 (MD) 17**] MD request. Pt remains ~10 L pos for LOS.

Access: R IJ QLCL, R aline, all ports flush and draw appropriately.

Plan:  Titrate levo gtt to maintain MAP >65, cont to monitor heme/resp status.  Re evaluate POC during rounds as pts status continues to decline.
