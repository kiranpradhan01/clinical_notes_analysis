Service:

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 65-year-old
white male with a history of type 2 diabetes and extensive
peripheral vascular disease who was initially admitted to the
Podiatry Service with a left forefoot cellulitis with
associated fevers and chills.  There was no trauma or foreign
body associated with the cellulitis.  Therefore, it was
opened and drained.  The patient was started on intravenous
antibiotics.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Type 2 diabetes.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Peripheral vascular disease.
4.  Hypercholesterolemia.
5.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Multiple foot surgeries.
2.  Right lower extremity bypass.
3.  Femoral-popliteal bypass.
4.  Aortobifemoral bypass.
5.  Graft in the renal artery.
6.  Endarterectomy.
7.  Umbilical hernia repair.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Glucovance 5/500 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. q.d., metoprolol 100 mg p.o.
b.i.d., Norvasc 2.5 mg p.o. b.i.d., Zestril 40 mg p.o. q.d.,
Lipitor 40 mg p.o. q.d., Prilosec 20 mg p.o. q.d.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on admission revealed the patient was alert and oriented
times three.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination
revealed were pupils were equal, round, and reactive to
light.  Extraocular movements were intact.  Cardiovascular
examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.  Normal first
heart sound and second heart sound.  No murmurs, gallops or
rubs.  Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  No
wheezes, rhonchi, or rales.  The abdomen was soft, nontender,
and nondistended.  No guarding.  Extremities revealed left
foot with erythema and edema, an open wound from incision
1 cm long.  Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses were
nonpalpable bilaterally.  Left foot was very warm.  Good
movement, and biphasic on Doppler.

ASSESSMENT:  This is a 44-year-old male with a past medical
history of type 2 diabetes, initially admitted for a left
lower extremity cellulitis with hospital course complicated
by a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, complicated
catheterization, and workup of left upper lobe mass found on
a pre-catheterization chest x-ray.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  The patient was originally
admitted on [**3178-11-16**] for left lower extremity
cellulitis to the Podiatry Service.

On [**3178-11-18**] the patient developed shortness of breath
and bilateral shoulder pain and ruled in for a non-Q-wave
myocardial infarction.  At that time, the patient was
transferred to the C-MED Service.  The patient had 1-mm ST
elevations in leads I and aVL with 2-mm ST depressions in
leads III, aVF, and V3 through V6.

The patient did not immediately undergo catheterization given
that he was still febrile from his left lower extremity
cellulitis, and it was unclear whether or not he would be
okay to have stents placed given his history of
osteomyelitis.

In addition, in the interval between developing the
non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, the patient also had some
hemoptysis which was followed up with a CT of the chest which
showed a left upper lobe mass.

Once the patient was afebrile, the patient underwent
catheterization.  The procedure was complicated by a small
dissection.  The patient had six stents placed in the right
coronary artery.  Given these complications, the patient was
transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for overnight
observation.

The patient was then transferred back to the C-MED Service.
It should also be noted that the patient also had a
echocardiogram after his myocardial infarction which was
significant for a moderately dilated left atrium, mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, with a normal left
ventricular cavity size, overall left ventricular systolic
function preservation; although, mild basal inferior
hypokinesis could not be excluded.  The right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion were normal.  Simple
atheroma on the aortic roots were seen.  The ascending aorta
was mildly dilated.  The aortic valve leaflets were
thickened.  No aortic regurgitation was seen.  The mitral
valve leaflets were mildly thickened with mild mitral
regurgitation.  Left ventricular inflow pattern suggested
impaired.  Ejection fraction of greater than 55% was
determined.

The patient remained stable on the C-MED Service and was
eventually transferred to the General Medicine Service.

2.  PULMONARY SYSTEM:  The patient apparently had a left
upper lobe mass which was seen on chest x-ray one month prior
to his presentation with left lower extremity cellulitis at
that time.  No further workup was done.  While in house the
patient developed hemoptysis, and a left lower lobe mass was
also seen on a follow-up chest x-ray.

A CT of the chest was done on [**11-20**] which showed a left
upper lobe mass that was speculated which was 3.6-cm X 5.3-cm
in size.

The patient was seen by the Pulmonary Service in house, and
he was preliminarily diagnosed with a likely stage III-B
bronchogenic lung cancer.  In order to make the full
diagnosis, the patient would need a tissue biopsy; however,
given his recent myocardial infarction, mediastinoscopy by
Cardiothoracic Surgery was deferred until the patient
recovered from his acute cardiovascular events.

3.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was treated for a left
lower extremity cellulitis with intravenous antibiotics while
he was in house.  The patient was treated with ciprofloxacin,
Flagyl, and oxacillin for cultures which grew out
Staphylococcus coagulase-positive bacteria.

The patient had a bone scan to both rule out metastases from
his lung mass and also to determine if there was any
osteomyelitis.  As per Podiatry, no osteomyelitis was
suggested, and the patient was continued on oxacillin while
in the hospital and changed over to oral dicloxacillin when
he was discharged from the hospital.

4.  FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION:  The patient seemed to
have some hyponatremia while in the hospital.  The patient
was fluid restricted.  It was unclear whether or not the
patient had syndrome of inappropriate secretion of
antidiuretic hormone.  A hyponatremia workup was initiated
while in house, and the patient was to follow up with his
primary care physician regarding the results of these tests.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  (The patient's discharge diagnoses
included)
1.  Left lower extremity cellulitis.
2.  Non-Q-wave myocardial infarction.
3.  Status post catheterization complicated by a small
dissection and six stent placement.
4.  A left upper lobe mass.
5.  Hyponatremia.
6.  Anemia.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient condition on discharge
was fair.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to home with
Visiting Nurse Association services.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  (The patient's discharge
medications included)
 1.  Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. q.d.
 2.  Amlodipine 2.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
 3.  Atorvastatin 40 mg p.o. q.d.
 4.  Pantoprazole 40 mg p.o. q.d.
 5.  Multivitamin p.o. q.d.

 8.  Clopidogrel 75 mg p.o. q.d. (for 30 days; with a start
date being [**3178-11-24**]).
 9.  Enoxaparin Sodium 100 mg subcutaneous q.12h. (the
patient was to continue taking this from the time of
discharge on [**3178-11-29**] until two weeks after that
date).

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:  (The patient had multiple
follow-up appointments to be made)
1.  The patient was to follow up with Cardiology
(Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]) in two weeks after his Lovenox course was
completed (telephone number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10890**]).

(Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4505**]).  The patient needed to follow up with Podiatry
when his antibiotic course was complete (telephone number
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 1542**]).
3.  The patient needed dressing changes every day by his
visiting nurse.
4.  The patient was to follow up with Cardiothoracic Surgery
(Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]) in one to two weeks after discharge to reassess
whether or not it was time for a mediastinoscopy (telephone
number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 555**]).
5.  The patient was to follow up with the [**Hospital 720**] Clinic given
his NPH insulin doses after being in the hospital and having
increased insulin requirements in the setting of stress
(telephone number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1771**]).
6.  The patient was also instructed to follow up with his

     INDICATION:  Smoking history with upper lobe mass.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous helical images of the thorax were obtained after
     administration of 100 cc IV Optiray.  Optiray was used for patient's history
     of allergies.
     
     No prior studies are available for comparison.
     
     CT THORAX WITH IV CONTRAST:  There are small axillary lymph nodes, none of
     which meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.  There are numerous
     mediastinal nodes, the largest occurring the subcarinal region measuring
     approximately 1.5 cm in short axis dimension.  Additionally, there are
     numerous pretracheal and AP window lymph nodes measuring up to approximately 1
     cm in diameter.  There is bilateral hilar adenopathy, left slightly greater
     than right, measuring up to 11 mm in short axis dimension.  Coronary artery
     and aortic calcifications are seen.  No pericardial effusion or pleural
     effusion.
     
     Evaluation of the lungs reveals a 3.6 x 5.3 cm spiculated mass in the left
     upper lobe with extension to the pleura.  There is diffuse centrilobular
      and bullous emphysema, most prominent in the upper lobes.  There is diffuse
     ground- glass opacification involving the posterior segment of the right upper
     lobe and, to a lesser degree, in the right middle lobe posteriorly and lingula
     medially. There are no pleural effusions.
     
     In the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, the visualized liver, spleen,
     pancreas, and adrenal glands are normal.  The kidneys are incompletely imaged.
      Small stones are seen dependently in the otehrwise normal gallbladder.
     
     Degenerative changes of the thoracic spine.  There are no suspicious lytic or
     blastic osseous lesions.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1. Left upper lobe mass most consistent with  primary bronchogenic carcinoma.
     Mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy.

     INDICATION:  Staging for lung cancer.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous helical images of the thorax were obtained after the
     administration of 100 cc of intravenous Optiray.  Optiray was used per the
     patient's history of allergies.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3178-11-20**].
     
     CT THORAX WITH IV CONTRAST:  There has been no significant change in
     mediastinal lymphadenopathy with an enlarged right paratracheal lymph node
     measuring 12 mm in short axis dimension and enlarged subcarinal node measuring
     approximately 11 mm in short axis dimension.  There is a borderline left lower
     paratracheal lymph node measuring approximately 1 cm in short axis dimension.
     There is additionally borderline enlarged bilateral hilar lymph nodes.  There
     are coronary artery and aortic calcifications.  No pericardial or pleural
     effusion.
     
     Evaluation of the lungs again reveals a left upper lobe spiculated mass with
     extension to the pleura.  This has not significantly changed, measuring
     approximately 3.6 x 5.2 cm.  There is diffuse centrilobular and bullous
     emphysema.  Patchy ground-glass opacities are slightly less prominent in the
     right upper lobe and slightly increased in the lower lobes bilaterally. The
     airways are patent to the level of the segmental bronchi bilaterally.
     
     In the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, there is no change from the prior
     exam.  Again noted are degenerative changes of the thoracic spine.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1)  Spiculated left upper lobe mass measuring approximately 3.7 x 5.2 cm,
     consistent with lung neoplasm.  Enlarged mediastinal lymph node and borderline
     bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy.  Considering the mildly enlarged
     contralateral mediastinal and hilar nodes, correlative PET imaging could be
     helpful for staging purposes.
     
     2)  Scattered ground-glass opacities, some increased and some improved since
     recent chest CT exam. These are new since the chest x-ray from [**3178-10-14**].  The
     rapid onset as well as the change in appearance over the previous 5 days,

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Sixty-five year old man with a lung mass that has grown over the past
     month and has a spiculated appearance on CT.  He also recently had a non Q wave
     MI which resulted in stenting of the RCA.  He also has diabetes mellitus with  
     peripheral ulcers for which he had to have his left first toe amputated.  This
     morning he had his left second toe debrided and he reports that it has been
     bleeding off and on since that time. 
      
     INTERPRETATION:  Flow images obtained in the anterior projection show asymmetric
     flow with the left distal foot showing greater flow of tracer than the right. 
     Tissue phase images obtained in three projections show greater accumulation of
     tracer in the left mid to distal foot compared to the right.  Skeletal phase
     images show abnormally increased tracer activity from the distal second
     metatarsal to the tip of the second phalanx  
      
     Whole body images of the skeleton show diffuse heterogeneous tracer uptake
     within the cervical spine.  There is also a focus of increased tracer activity
     at one of the mid thoracic vertebrae just to the right of midline at the
     costovertebral juncion.  Also seen is increased accumulation of tracer in the
     left knee.  These changes are consistent with degenerative joint disease. 
      
     The kidneys and urinary bladder are visualized, the normal route of tracer
     excretion. 
      
     IMPRESSION:  1) No evidence of metastases.  2) Positive three phase bone scan at
     the left metatarsal extending distally, which given the patient's history could
     represent either osteomyelitis or post traumatic changes.

     INDICATION:  Known left upper lobe mass.  Evaluate for resolving fluid
     overload.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired axial images were obtained from the thoracic
     inlet to the lung bases using IV contrast.
     
     CONTRAST:  100 cc of Optiray was given due to patient debility.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3178-11-25**].
     
     CHEST CT WITH IV CONTRAST:  Again seen is a large spiculated mass in the left
     upper lobe measuring 5.4 X 4.3 cm, slightly increased in size compared to the
     previous study.  There is some adjacent pleural thickening in the left upper
     lobe anteriorly, which may reflect involvement by tumor vs. a benign
     desmoplastic reaction.  There has been interval resolution in the previously
     seen multifocal areas of ground-glass opacities, most prominent at the lung
     bases.  There is moderate centrilobular emphysema, most severe at the lung
     apices.  There are nonspecific interstitial changes at the lung bases which
     may reflect nonspecific scarring or fibrosis, with mild interstitial edema
     less likely.
     
     There are several enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes present in the right
     paratracheal, precarinal, subcarinal, and AP window distribution measuring
     approximately 12 to 13 mm in diameter.  Enlarged left lower paratracheal lymph
     nodes are also seen.  Small subcentimeter hilar lymph nodes are present

     INDICATION:  Known left upper lobe mass.  Evaluate for resolving fluid
     overload.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired axial images were obtained from the thoracic
     inlet to the lung bases using IV contrast.
     
     CONTRAST:  100 cc of Optiray was given due to patient debility.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3178-11-25**].
     
     CHEST CT WITH IV CONTRAST:  Again seen is a large spiculated mass in the left
     upper lobe measuring 5.4 X 4.3 cm, slightly increased in size compared to the
     previous study.  There is some adjacent pleural thickening in the left upper
     lobe anteriorly, which may reflect involvement by tumor vs. a benign
     desmoplastic reaction.  There has been interval resolution in the previously
     seen multifocal areas of ground-glass opacities, most prominent at the lung
     bases.  There is moderate centrilobular emphysema, most severe at the lung
     apices.  There are nonspecific interstitial changes at the lung bases which
     may reflect nonspecific scarring or fibrosis, with mild interstitial edema
     less likely.
     
     There are several enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes present in the right
     paratracheal, precarinal, subcarinal, and AP window distribution measuring
     approximately 12 to 13 mm in diameter.  Enlarged left lower paratracheal lymph
     nodes are also seen.  Small subcentimeter hilar lymph nodes are present
     bilaterally.  There are extensive coronary artery calcifications.  The heart
     size is normal.  There are no pleural or pericardial effusions.
     
     In the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, the liver, spleen, adrenal glands,
     pancreas, and upper poles of the kidneys are unremarkable.  There are

 Patient afebrile all day and hemodynamically stable off pressors. Once PPF turned off and pt was extubated BP up to 130-160. HR 60-80 in NSR with no ectopy. PO BP meds restarted and tolerated lisinopril/lopressor well. Pt was given his regular dose of PO lasix did not diurese much after dose but maintained adequate urine output and is currently negative 500cc since midnight.
 PO diet restarted-pt ate well at dinner time and was given 1/2 dose of am nph (while NPO) and full dose of NPH at dinner (pt reported he takes NPH at breakfast time and dinner time while at home).
 Podiatry came by and changed pt's foot dressing around 11am. Plan is for pt to return to OR some time next week. Pulses have remained dopplerable all day.
 After pt was extubated O2 was weaned down to 4L nc and o2 sats have been 97-99%. Pt has a strong cough and is able to cough and raise independently. Lungs have been clear.

NPN 7Am-3PM

Had family meeting today at 1130 am. Attending, fellow, primary RN and pt's wife and 3 daughters were present. MD explained that pt was declining despite all treatments and had been somewhat unstable this AM, with GI bleeding, O2 desaturation and v tach during bed bath. Family had already decided that pt should be DNR, but now they say keep pt comfortable. We started MSO4 drip  at 1215 to keep pt comfortable, at 3-5 mg per hour. AT  1315 we repositioned pt, HR dropped to 40, family at bedside. At 1345 pt hr dropped to twenty then asystole. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] came by and pronounced pt at 1400. family stayed with pt for 45 minutes. Upper and lower dentures were placed in pt mouth and belongings and glasses were sent home with family.
