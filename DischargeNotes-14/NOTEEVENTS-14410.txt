HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**Known patient firstname 10592**] [**Known patient lastname 10593**] is a 77 year
old woman with coronary artery disease, congestive heart
failure, obesity, hypoventilation syndrome and obstructive
[**Doctor Last Name 292**] apnea who had O2 sats of 62 to 69% on room air and an
arterial blood gas of pH 7.3, pCO2 69 and pO2 41 at [**Hospital3 **].  She's been at [**Hospital1 **] for the past 3 months for
chronic vertigo and a question of vestibular neuronitis. She
notes increased fatigue for the past few days as well as more
difficulty breathing when lying flat (she has been using more
pillows than usual).  She has recently been tapered off Lasix
and her beta blocker and Imd[**MD Number 10594**] been increased. She denies
shortness of breath, cough, chest pain, pain or swelling in
the legs or increased salt intake. She has been compliant
with meds at the rehab.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1. Coronary artery disease, status
post MI in [**3013**], status post stent LAD [**3023-6-6**], with
subsequent cardiac catheterization on [**3027-6-7**] showing 100%
LAD occlusion.  2. Congestive heart failure, left ventricular
ejection fraction of 40% according to her records, unclear
when this echo was performed.  3.  Vestibular neuronitis.  4.
Obstructive [**Doctor Last Name 292**] apnea and obesity hypoventilation syndrome.
5. Hypertension.  6. Cerebrovascular accident.  7. Upper GI
bleed.  8. Thrombocytopenia.  9. Status post hemicolectomy
and appendectomy.  10. Hiatal hernia.  11. Vaginal bleeding.
12. Dysphagia.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's sister has coronary artery

with a myocardial infarction at age 55.  The patient's mother
lived to 103 and had a cerebrovascular accident.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was alert and lying
comfortably in bed. Vital signs: Temp 98.6, BP 140/72, pulse
60, respiratory rate 18, O2 sat 96% on 2 liters and 85% on
room air.  HEENT: NCAT, oropharynx clear, pupils equal, round

Decreased breath sounds in the middle lung fields and at the
bases with occasional basilar crackles.  Heart: Normal S1 and
S2, II/VI systolic ejection murmur at the upper sternal

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count within normal limits
throughout hospital stay, hematocrit 29.4 to 31.5, platelets
112 to 124, MCV 96.  Sodium 145, potassium 4.6, chloride 103,
bicarb 30 to 36, BUN 19 to 26, creatinine 0.9 to 1.3, glucose
79 to 111.  Arterial blood gases: On [**3027-7-7**] pH 7.22, pO2
105, pCO2 103, bicarb 44.  [**3027-7-8**] pH 7.26, pO2 41, pCO2 97,
bicarb 46.  [**3027-7-9**] pH 7.26, pO2 59, pCO2 93, bicarb 44.
[**3027-7-10**] pH 7.33, pO2 52, pCO2 79, bicarb 44.  PT 12.9, PTT
25.1, INR 1.1.  Calcium 9.3, ionized calcium 1.22, magnesium
2.3, phosphate 2.4, TSH 5.1, free T4 pending. TIBC 319, iron
30, ferritin 17, transferrin 245, vitamin B12 247, folate
15.2.  Blood toxin screen was negative.  Lactate 0.5.

Tests: [**3027-7-7**] CTA test with and without contrast showed no
evidence of pulmonary embolus.  There was a large hiatal
hernia.  There was atelectasis in the lower lobe. There was a
right kidney mass and there were small pleural effusions.
[**3027-7-7**] chest x-ray showed mild congestive heart failure.
[**3027-7-9**] chest x-ray showed interval resolution of CHF as well
as a large heart, large hiatal hernia and small bilateral
pleural effusions.  EKG showed sinus rhythm at 65
beats/minute and left bundle branch block which was new since
[**5-/3023**] compared to previous records at [**Hospital3 **] but
according to [**Hospital3 **] this was an old finding.
[**3027-7-8**] renal ultrasound showed a 1 cm right upper pole
kidney cyst, most consistent with a simple cyst.
Transthoracic echocardiogram [**3027-7-10**] showed moderate
dilatation of the left atrium, left ventricular ejection
fraction of 40%, hypokinesis of the inferior wall and septum,
1+ mitral regurgitation, 1+ tricuspid regurgitation and
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  Pulmonary function
tests [**3027-7-10**] showed significant reduction in lung volumes
consistent with a restrictive pattern.  FEV1 to FCC ratio was
147% of predicted, the LCO could not be performed.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1. Hypoxemia/hypercarbia.  In the Emergency
Department the patient had a CTA of the chest which was
negative for pulmonary embolus.  The chest x-ray showed mild
CHF and she was diuresed with 40 mg of Lasix IV with urine
output of 1.5 liters.  Three arterial blood gases were
performed (results shown above).  Due to her hypoxia and
hypercarbia she was admitted to the MICU for a trial of
noninvasive ventilation with [**Hospital1 **].  The patient did not
tolerate [**Hospital1 **] due to discomfort and was called down to the
Floor on [**3027-7-8**]. She was seen by Pulmonary consult who
thought that her hypercarbia and hypoxemia were likely due to
a multifactorial restrictive process involving obesity and
large hiatal hernia as well as a decreased drive to breathe.
Her pulmonary hypertension was felt to be secondary to
chronic hypercarbia and hypoxemia. They recommended weight
loss, pulmonary rehabilitation and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 292**] study with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 339**] at the [**Hospital1 **] [**Doctor Last Name **] Lab as well as outpatient
followup in Pulmonary Clinic with possible
Medroxyprogesterone trial 10 mg t.i.d. which might help
decrease pCO2 after 3 to 4 weeks of treatment.  An
appointment was scheduled with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at the [**Hospital1 19**]
Pulmonary Clinic for [**7-25**].

2. CAD/CHF.  In the ED she was given Lasix and diuresed 1.5
liters.  Her echo showed ejection fraction of 40% and
hypokinesis of the inferior wall and septum, likely due to
her previous MI.  A repeat chest x-ray showed interval
resolution of her mild CHF.  She was restarted on Lasix 20
mg p.o. q.d.  Her Ace inhibitor was increased from 5 mg p.o.
q.d. to 5 mg p.o. b.i.d. for better afterload reduction.

3. Normocytic anemia and history of upper GI bleed.  Her B12
and folate were within normal limits.  Her iron studies
suggest iron deficiency with an iron to TIBC ratio of less
than 10%.  Her hematocrit was stable throughout her hospital
stay.  Iron sulfate supplementation was started.  Her rectal
exam was guaiac positive, therefore, an endoscopy and
colonoscopy are recommended as an outpatient.  Her PPI was
continued in house.

4. Endocrine.  Her TSH was slightly elevated at 5.1.  A free
T4 was pending at the time of discharge.  Her P.C.P. will be
notified of this.

5. Fluid, electrolytes and nutrition.  She tolerated p.o.'s
well throughout hospital stay.

6. Psychiatry.  She was frequently agitated and combative
with signs of paranoia but generally consolable.  This was
worse with sundowning at night.  Her psychiatric meds were
continued in house. She was given Haldol 1 mg IV once on the
evening of admission.

7. Renal.  Renal ultrasound was done to further evaluate the
mass seen on CT of the chest.  Per Radiology the right kidney
mass is likely a simple cyst.
