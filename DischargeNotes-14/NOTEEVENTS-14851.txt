CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Sepsis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  74-year-old African American
female with hypertension, status post TAH BSO who was
admitted to the MICU for hypotension and respiratory
distress.  The patient reported three days of right flank
pain that was slightly better the day of admission.
Urinalysis and blood showed E. coli which was pansensitive,
treated with Levaquin.  In the following few days she was
gradually weaned off of pressor support but then had episode
of bradycardia and hypotension.  Echocardiogram at that time
showed right ventricular dilatation suggestive of large PE.
The patient was made DNR on Friday, [**3-3**] and then to comfort
measures only on [**3206-3-6**].  She passed away at 3-16 in the
p.m. from hypertension and respiratory failure.  Her
attending and family was notified.  Family has decided
against autopsy at this time.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  74 year old woman with hypotension.
     
     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images of the chest, abdomen and pelvis were
     obtained without contrast.
     
     CHEST CT WITHOUT CONTRAST:  The soft tissue windows show no significant
     axillary, mediastinal or hilar lymph node enlargement.  The heart and
     pericardium are unremarkable.  The intrathoracic aorta has a normal caliber.
     There is a small amount of soft tissue material around the aortic root, which
     is unlikely to represent free fluid.  There are no pleural effusions.
     
     The lung windows show no pulmonary nodules or areas of parenchymal
     consolidation.  There is minimal bilateral dependent atelectasis.  The airways
     appear patent to the level of the segmental bronchi bilaterally.
     
     ABDOMINAL CT WITHOUT CONTRAST:  The gallbladder is distended, with no
     surrounding fat stranding.  The liver, pancreas, spleen, stomach, small and
     large bowel are unremarkable.  The descending colon contains multiple
     diverticula, with no evidence of diverticulitis.  The intra-abdominal aorta
     has a normal caliber and exhibits minimal mural calcifications.  There is no
     free fluid around the aorta.  Bilateral kidneys show no hydronephrosis.
     Calcification in the midpolar region of the right kidney could represent a
     nonobstructing renal stone or vascular calcifications.  The right kidney
     contains two cysts, the largest measuring 4.3 x 3.9 cm.  Bilateral adrenal
     glands are normal.  There is no free fluid and no free air in the abdomen. Gas
     in the IVC is likely related to inguinal catheter placement. There are
     multiple lymph nodes in the mesentery, celiac and paraortic regions.
     
     PELVIC CT WITHOUT CONTRAST:  The urinary bladder contains fluid, gas and a
     Foley catheter.  There is a vascular catheter in the right groin.  The rectum
     and pelvic loops of bowel are unremarkable.  The uterus and ovaries are not
     visualized.  There is no free fluid, and no pelvic or inguinal
     lymphadenopathy.
     
     Osseous structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Normal caliber aorta with no evidence of rupture.
     2.  Possible right-sided renal stone with no hydronephrosis.

     INDICATION:  Sepsis.  Intubation.  Shortness of breath.
     
     Comparison is made to previous radiograph of one day earlier.
     
     The endotracheal tube is present, with the tip of the tube terminating within
     1 cm of the carina.  The central venous catheter remains in satisfactory
     position.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  There is worsening
     left retrocardiac opacity.  There is probably a small left pleural effusion.
     Note is made of new patchy right basilar opacity.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Low position of endotracheal tube, terminating within 1 cm of the
     carina.
     
     Increasing left retrocardiac opacity.  Given the position of the endotracheal
     tube, this likely reflects atelectasis.
     
     New patchy right lower lobe opacity which may reflect patchy atelectasis,
     aspiration, or early focus of infection.  Follow up films are suggested.

MICU Admit note

74 YOF admitted to MICU for hypotension, probable urosepsis, resp. distress.  Pt. brought to MICU intubated and on Dopamine with fluids wide open.  

HPI:  Pt. brought to ER about 3pm by EMS.  Pt. feeling malaise, SOB and right flank pain X 3 days.  Pt. also reports having multiple soft bowel movements X 3 days.  In the ER, noted to have a BP 50-60/20's with temp 96.  4L of NS given during ER stay and 2 u of PRBC per Sx.  BP up to 70's.  Sx. consulted to r/o Triple A.  Pt. received 1u of PRBC and went to CT; CT ruled out Triple A.  However, during CT, pt. developed worsening SOB and wheezes.  PRBC transfusion stopped.  Pt. treated with racemic epi and transfusion work-up labs appropriately sent.  ABGs drawn at this time showing worsening acidosis (7.30 down to 7.10).  Pt. had also received 1 abx. prior to this event as well.  MDs calling this event a transfusion reaction. Pt. intubated at that time.

     INDICATIONS:    Worsening oxygen requirement.
     
     AP CHEST:  Comparison to film from prior day.  There has been interval
     worsening of the bilateral patchy multifocal opacities.  The rapid progression
     over the given time course suggests pulmonary edema.  There is persistentce of
     a consolidation in the left lower lobe that may represent atelectasis or
     aspiration pneumonia.  A small right effusion is probably present.  The
     cardiac, mediastinal hilar contours are unchanged.  An ET tube is in
     appropriate position as is a left subclavian tube with the tip in the junction
     of the SVC and brachiocephalic vein.

     1.  Interval worsening of bilateral opacities. Given the time course of
     development, this is suggestive of pulmonary edema.
     
     2.  Persistent left lower lobe opacity which may represent atelectasis or
     consolidation associated with aspiration pneumonia.

Resp: Pt on PCV with driving pressure of 20, Peep 15, FiO2 100%.  She was suctioned for minimal amount of tan secretions.  ABG following the amp of bicarb given before 700 showed a pH of 7.26.  Several changes were made, I:E was changed to 1:1 FiO2 dropped to 90%, driving pressure decreased to 18 and RR increased to 28 to increase minute ventilation.  She decrease her pH to a low of 7.16.  It was decided that a swan was to be placeded so a right femerol catheter was placed for the gtt's. The left subclavian was going to be changed to a swan introducer but the site was lost.  With the attempt to restart the line the patient started to have copious BRB from the ETT.  ~200cc of blood was suctioned from the ETT.  Anesthesia was called adn a double lumen ETT was placed.  The CXR showed a left upper lobe pneumothorax so a chest tube was place in the left anterior chest.  Initially it drained blood but it gradually changed to serosang drainage.  The vent settings that she ended with were PCV driving pressure of 20, Peep 18, RR 28.  FiO2 has been decreased to 60% after ABG of 163/31/7.28.  

Cardiac: Initially her B/P was 88/53 on Levo of 5mcg/min and Pitressin of 0.08 u/min but over the next hour she when into Afib, and dropped her pressure requiring increasing the levo to 21.3mcg/min.  The lasix was D/C'ed and she was given 2 250 cc NS boluses and IVF was increased to 250cc/hr over the next 2 hours.  With the above incident she again dropped her pressure requiring increasing the pitressing to a max of 0.1u/[**Last Name (LF) 141**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] Neo was added as a third pressor.  It was during this time she did convert back to NSR with an improvement in B/P but she did not remain in NSR and dropped her B/P again.  She started to improve when her ABG's finally improved.  The Neo was weaned off and the Pitressin was weaned.  At this time the Pitressin is at 0.04 u/min and the levo remains at 21.3mcg/min.  Her B/P is 115-120/70's, HR 120-130 Afib.  

Heme:  Pt received a bag of platlets at 9am for a platlet count of 9, the repeat was 60.  With her bleeding out the ETT she was given a second bag of platlets and 2 units of FFP with the chest tube insertion.  Her last HCT was 30.7 and plat ct 106.

ID:  Her temp initially was 100.4 but dropped to 97.9.  Her WBC's increased to 20.5.  She remains on Levoflaxacin.

Neuro:  She is sedated on Fentanyl 75 mcg/hr and ativan 1.5 mg/hr. When she was reintubated the ativan was increased to 3mg/hr and she was paralysed with cisatracurium.  The paralytic was started on 0.186mg/kg/hr with good effect.

GI: The OGT placed yesterday was D/C'ed during the reintubation.  It has been replaced and tube feedings will be started with criticare at 10 cc/hr when the tube placement is confirmed by X-ray. 

GU:  Foley has been draining small amount of clear yellow urine with output between 10-20 cc/hr.  

Social:  Family meeting held with her son [**Name (NI) 230**] and her neices [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1247**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], [**Doctor First Name 39**], and [**Doctor First Name 5329**].  Her condition was explained and all questions answered and

     SINGLE PORTABLE RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST: The cardiomediastinal and hilar
     contours are unchanged in appearance. This study is limited due to patient
     rotation. The right lung appears clear. There is persistent opacification of
     the lingular and left upper lobe. A dual lumen ETT is seen with distal lumen
     projecting into left main stem bronchus and proximal lumen terminating
     approximately 1 cm above the carina. An NG tube is seen with tip descending
     below the field of view. A left sided chest tube is seen with tip overlying
     the lung apex. The soft tissue and osseous structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) Dual lumen ETT with distal lumen in left main stem bronchus and proximal
     lumen within 1 cm of the carina. These findings are communicated with Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 12923**].
     2) Persistent opacification of left upper lobe and lingula. Given the marked
     rotation of the patient, it is difficult to evaluate the left lung. However,
     some element of left upper lobe collapse cannot be excluded.
     3) NG tube tip extending below the field of view.

     INDICATION:  Evaluate for fluid overload or evidence of right heart failure.
     
     FINDINGS:  A single portable chest radiograph is compared with the portable
     study dated [**3206-3-2**].  A dual lumen endotracheal tube is redemonstrated with
     the distal lumen extending into the left main stem bronchus and proximal lumen
     terminating approximately 2 cm above the carina.  The NG tube is again seen
     with tip descending below the field of view.  The left sided chest tube is
     also unchanged in appearance with tip projecting over the left apex.
     
     There has been significant increase in the extensive bilateral consolidations.
     Air bronchograms are demonstrated bilaterally.  No definite pleural effusions
     or septal lines are appreciated.  These new findings may be consistent with
     central pulmonary edema or ARDS.  However, pneumonia cannot be ruled out in
     this locations.  The previously described consolidations involving the left
     upper lobe and lingula appear relatively unchanged.  No upper zone vascular
     redistribution is demonstrated.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1)  Significant increase in alveolar consolidations in both lungs
     .  This may be consistent with central pulmonary edema or ARDS. Pneumonia in
     this location also cannot be excluded. Clinical correlation is suggested.
     
     2)  Relatively unchanged appearance of the left upper lobe and left lingular
     consolidations.
