     INDICATION:  Altered mental status.  Evaluate for hemorrhage.
     
     There are no prior studies for comparison.
     
     NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT SCAN:  The examination is slightly limited by patient
     motion.  There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or shift of the
     normally midline structures.  The ventricles and sulci are prominent,
     consistent with moderate involutional change.  There is hypodensity of the
     cerebral periventricular white matter, consistent with chronic microvascular
     infarction.  This is particularly prominent adjacent to the atrium of the
     right lateral ventricle.  There is a mucous retention cyst within the right
     maxillary sinus.  Other visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are
     well aerated.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.  Chronic
     microvascular infarction.
     
     Please note that MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging is more sensitive for the
     detection of acute ischemia.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Abdominal pain.  Evaluate for mesenteric ischemia.
     
     There are no prior studies for comparison.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images through the abdomen and pelvis were
     obtained without IV contrast.  Subsequently, following the administration of
     120 cc of IV Optiray, contiguous axial images through the abdomen and pelvis
     were obtained in the arterial and portal venous phases.  Multiplanar
     reformatted images were generated.
     
     CT STUDY OF THE ABDOMEN:  There are atherosclerotic calcifications and plaques
     of the abdominal aorta.  There are atherosclerotic calcifications at the
     origin of the celiac, SMA, bilateral renal arteries and [**Female First Name (un) **].  Just inferior to
     the origin of the right renal artery, there is a thin intimal flap visualized
     along the right side of the aorta extending 2 cm inferiorly, to the level of
     another atherosclerotic plaque.  This appears to represent a small focal
     dissection.  At the origin of the SMA, the aorta measures 1.9 x 2.1 cm.  In
     the area of the dissection flap, the aorta measures 1.8 x 1.7 cm.  The aorta
     enlarges slightly just inferior to the origin of the inferior mesenteric
     artery, measuring 1.9 x 1.9 cm.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  There are mild-to-moderate dependent changes
     at the lung bases bilaterally.  There is increased enhancement of the left
     lobe of the liver anteriorly compared with the remainder of the liver, and a
     small wedge-shaped area of hyperenhancement of the lateral left lobe.  These
     may represent small perfusion anomalies.  There appears to be a single
     prominent duct in the left lobe of the liver (series 3B, image 200), the
     portal vein is patent.  There is pericholecystic fluid seen, tracking up into
     the porta hepatis.  The gallbladder is distended, and there is wall edema
     visualized.  There is hyperemia of the adjacent hepatic parenchyma.  These
     findings suggest acute cholecystitis.  There is a very small amount of ascites
                                                                 (Over)

     fluid anterior to the liver.  The spleen and adrenal glands are normal.  The
     kidneys enhance symmetrically.  There are rounded low-attenuation lesions of
     the lower poles of both kidneys, which are not fully characterized on this
     study.  The right kidney lower pole lesion appears to have septations or be
     composed of adjacent cysts.  The structure measures 1.7 x 1.2 cm in axial
     dimensions.  The body and tail of the pancreas are atrophic.  The common duct
     measures up to 11 mm in the pancreatic head, but tapers as expected.  Some
     fluid and stranding is seen adjacent to the pancreatic head.  There is no free
     air in the abdomen.  There is a small hiatal hernia.  Small bowel loops are
     not dilated.  There are colonic diverticula, without evidence of
     diverticulitis.  No pathologically enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal
     lymph nodes.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The bladder and rectum are normal.  There is
     sigmoid diverticulosis, without evidence of diverticulitis.  The patient is
     post hysterectomy.  There are calcifications within rounded soft tissue
     density structures in both sides of the pelvis, which may represent ovaries.
     These are seen on series 3B, image 297.  In addition, there is a rounded focus
     of fluid within the pelvis between small bowel loops measuring 2.9 x 3.9 cm in
     diameter.  No pathologically enlarged pelvic or inguinal lymph nodes.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious osteolytic or sclerotic lesions.  There
     are degenerative changes of the lumbar spine.
     
     Multiplanar reformatted images were essential in delineating the anatomy and
     pathology in this case.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  The gallbladder is distended, with wall edema, pericholecystic fluid and
     hyperemia of the adjacent liver.  The findings are suggestive of acute
     cholecystitis.
     2.  Severe atherosclerosis of the aorta. There is a penetrating ulcer vs.
     focal dissection of the abdominal aorta, from the level just inferior to the
     right renal artery origin, extending for approximately 2 cm.
     3.  Small amount of ascites fluid adjacent to the liver.
     4.  Fluid and stranding near the pancreatic head.  This could be related to
     adjacent cholecystitis, or could be a manifestation of pancreatitis.  There is
     a somewhat focal dilation of the common duct to 11 mm in the pancreatic head,
     which subsequently tapers.
     5.  Calcified structures in both sides of the pelvis, which may represent
     ovaries.  There is a rounded area of fluid between small bowel loops in the
     pelvis, which may reflect ascites fluid or a duplication cyst.
     6.  Sigmoid diverticulosis, without evidence of diverticulitis.
     
     Findings numerals one and two were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8619**] at the
     conclusion of the exam.

.
CT abd/pelvis:
1. The gallbladder is distended, with wall edema, 
pericholecystic fluid and hyperemia of the adjacent liver. The 
findings are suggestive of acute cholecystitis.
2. Severe atherosclerosis of the aorta. There is a penetrating 
ulcer vs. focal dissection of the abdominal aorta, from the 
level just inferior to the right renal artery origin, extending 
for approximately 2 cm.
3. Small amount of ascites fluid adjacent to the liver.
4. Fluid and stranding near the pancreatic head. This could be 
related to adjacent cholecystitis, or could be a manifestation 
of pancreatitis. There is a somewhat focal dilation of the 
common duct to 11 mm in the pancreatic head, which subsequently 
tapers.
5. Calcified structures in both sides of the pelvis, which may 
represent ovaries. There is a rounded area of fluid between 
small bowel loops in the pelvis, which may reflect ascites fluid 
or a duplication cyst.
6. Sigmoid diverticulosis, without evidence of diverticulitis.
.
head CT: evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage. Chronic 
microvascular infarction.
Please note that MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging is more 
sensitive for the detection of acute ischemia.
.
CXR:Question COPD. Upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF. 
No pneumonic infiltrate.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 89 y.o. female with  a h/o CVA, dementia, Type 1 DM, 
hypertension and ""h/o pancreas problems"" who presented initially 
with chest pain and and found to have cholecystitis and 
infrarenal aortic ulceration/dissection. 
.  
1) Cholecystitis: Patient status post cholecystostomy tube 
placement, cholecystectomy deferred due to comorbidities. No 
signs of cholangitis, as blood pressure stable, her fever curve 
trended down, and WBC count and alk. phos. trending downward.   
Her bile fluid grew [**Female First Name (un) 929**] but ID said to hold on treaating 
this unless she is unstable or blood cultures positive for 
[**Female First Name (un) 929**] The antibiotics were first narrowed to cipro and flagyl 
and then changed to PO.  Per surgery, cholecystostomy tube 
should be in place for 6 weeks and she will be followed by 
interventional radiology for this.  
.  
2) Acute renal failure - The patient had a slight creatinine 
bump, likely secondary to dehydration/pre-renal picture given 
the cr improved with IVF.  Her lisinopril and atenolol were 
initially held but restarted after her ARF improved. 
.  
3) Aortic dissection ulceration - As repeat scan done at [**Hospital1 19**] 
did not show worsening dissection, vascular recommended 
improving blood pressure control by uptitrating her regimen as 
tolerated. Nifedipine was increased to 120 mg qdaily and she was 
continued on atenolol and lisinopril.  She will need a repeat 
CTA of the abdomen and pelvis with and without contrast in 3-6 
months to evaluate the focal dissection of the abdominal aorta, 
from the level just inferior to the right renal artery origin.
.  
4) Non-anion gap acidosis - The patient had low bicarbonate, 
likely secondary to biliary drainage, and this remained stable.  

.  
5) CAD - The patient has a history of remote NQWMI per [**Hospital1 717**] 
records, but had no issues here and was continued on all 
appropriate medications including nifedipine, lisinopril, 
atenolol, and ASA.  Given her LFT elevation her atorvastatin was 
held.  It was trending down at discharge and should be rechecked 
as an outpatient.  Her statin should be restarted if her LFT's 
are normal.   
.  
6) transaminitis: The patient had elevated liver enzymes, likely 
[**2-15**] reactive hyperaemia of liver surrounding inflamed gall 
bladder, as this improved during her course.  These should be 
checked at rehab and if completely normal would restart 
mirtazapine 15 mg daily and atorvastatin 10 mg daily as these 
were held
.
7) Diabetes mellitus - Has been on sliding scale in house, and 
was initially given 10NPH in AM and 6NPH in PM based on recent 
sliding scale requirements.  This was increased per daily needs 
and should continue to be followed as an outpatient.  
.  
8) Depression - We held the patient's mirtazapine given 
transaminitis; continue to hold until she demonstrates stable 
hepatic function and then would restart her mirtazapine.
.
9) Fever - The patient had a low grade fever which resolved.  
Her CXR and urine culture was negative.  Her blood has no growth 
to date, but should be followed up final cultures by her PCP.  
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] may have had a viral syndrome as she had a slight cough, 
fevers and chills.  At discharge she was afebrile with no signs 
of infection.
.
10) Dispo - The patient will be at [**Hospital3 6518**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10482**], 
where a physician from Dr.[**Doctor Last Name 10483**] practice, or Dr. 
[**Last Name (STitle) **] will see the patient.[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10484**] will be help

     wall is not thickened nor is it edematous.  No gallstones are seen.  The main
     portal vein is patent, and its flow is hepatopetal.  Few images through all
     four quadrants of the abdomen demonstrate no ascites or fluid collections.
     During our study, it was noted that the patient was diffusely tender in all
     four quadrants.
     
     Given that the patient is on aspirin and given the appearance of the
     gallbladder at this time, a decision was made not to place a new drain at this
     time.
     
     Findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Young on [**3011-3-13**].
     
     IMPRESSION:  Nondistended gallbladder without an edematous wall.  No
     gallstones seen.
     
     Further workup is recommended at this time, as the patient is diffusely
     tender.  At this time, there is no fluid seen in the imaged four quadrants of
     the abdomen.  CT scan may be advisable for further evaluation.

     CLINICAL HISTORY:  89-year-old female with abdominal pain, leukocytosis and
     history of recent cholecystitis.  Patient now with diffuse abdominal pain.
     Rule out abscess, peritonitis, perforation, abdominal pathology.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3011-3-4**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contrast enhanced multidetector CT acquired axial images of the
     abdomen and pelvis from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis.  Multiplanar
     reformatted images were obtained.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  Again seen are mild-to-moderate
     dependent changes at the lung bases bilaterally.  No focal liver lesions are
     seen. The gallbladder is nondistended.  No stone is seen within the
     gallbladder.  There is a small amount of pericholecystic fluid, which may be
     related to the small amount of ascites adjacent to the liver.  There is no
     evidence of cholecystitis.  The spleen and adrenal glands are within normal
     limits. Multiple low attenuation lesions are seen within both kidneys, too
     small to fully characterized, however, unchanged from [**3011-3-4**].
     Pancreas is atrophic.  Previously noted hypodensity and stranding around the
     head of the pancreas has resolved.  There is no billiary or pacreatic ductal
     dilitation.  No free air is noted within the abdomen.  Small hiatal hernia is
     seen.  Intra-abdominal loops of small bowel are within normal limits.  Colonic
     diverticula are seen without evidence of diverticulitis.  No pathologically
     enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph nodes are apparent.  Again noted
     is focal dissection of the abdominal aorta at the level just inferior to the
     right renal origin, unchanged from prior CT dated [**3011-3-4**].
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The bladder and rectum are within
     normal limits.  There is sigmoid diverticulosis, without evidence of
     diverticulitis. A right adnexal cyst measuring 2.0 x 3.6 cm is present.  The
     left adnexa is unremarkable.  Calcifications are seen within the pelvic side
     walls as previously mentioned, unchanged.  These may represent calcified lymph
     nodes as seen in the abdomen.  No pathologically enlarged pelvic or inguinal
     lymph nodes are apparent.  There is trace free fluid within the pelvis.  No
     suspicious osteolytic or sclerotic lesion is seen.  Multilevel degenerative
     changes are again noted throughout the thoracolumbar spine.

     INDICATION FOR STUDY:  Evaluate for cholecystitis.  Comparison is made with
     prior study from [**3011-3-5**], and from [**3011-3-13**].  This is an
     extremely limited study since the patient did not allow us to scan her upper
     abdomen.  Limited images of the gallbladder show a distended gallbladder with
     no wall thickening or edema, no pericholecystic fluid is noted and no intra-
     or extra-hepatic bile duct dilatation is identified.  Apart from slight
     increase in distention of the gallbladder, there is no change in the overall
     appearance compared with study from [**3-13**].  The extent of wall
     thickening is also unchanged.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Slight increase in distention of gallbladder from study obtained
     on [**3011-3-13**], however there is no gallbladder wall thickening, as was
     noted on the previous study from [**3-5**] and no pericholecystic fluid or

     Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5880**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast MDCT imaging of the abdomen was performed.  No IV
     contrast was administered as the patient has allergy to IV contrast.
     
     NON-CONTRAST ABDOMINAL CT:  Dual-chamber pacemaker leads are present.  There
     is dependent atelectasis bilaterally.  Assessment of solid abdominal organs is
     limited without IV contrast.  Allowing for the limitations, assessment of the
     liver shows an irregular contour bulge in segment V which is incompletely
     assessed without IV contrast, but apparently new since [**3011-3-14**].  The
     gallbladder is diffusely dilated, but shows no definite pericholecystic fluid.
     Both adrenal glands are bulky but unchanged in appearance since the prior
     abdominal CT.  There is a 3-mm nonobstructing left renal stone.  There is no
     ascites, pneumatosis, or free intraperitoneal air.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is diffuse colonic wall
     thickening and edema.  There is relative sparing of the base of the cecum and
     no involvement of the terminal ileum.  Small bowel loops are unremarkable.
     There has been prior hysterectomy.  The bladder is collapsed about a Foley
     catheter. There is a small amount of fluid in the pelvis. Bilateral adnexal
     calcifications are unchanged. The associated cystic structure in the right
     adnexa is smaller.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  Diffuse degenerative changes are present in the spine, hip
     joints, sacroiliac joints, and pubic symphysis, with enthesophyte formation
     along both ischial tuberosities.  No frankly lytic or sclerotic lesions are
     identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Diffuse colitis.  Given fever and leukocytosis, infectious causes are most
     likely.  Findings are consistent with C. difficile colitis in the correct
     clinical context.  Differential diagnosis includes ischemia given

     HISTORY:  89-year-old woman with altered mental status and hypotension, status
     post intubation; evaluate ET tube.
     
     FINDINGS:  Bedside AP examination labeled ""supine, 15:10 hours"" is compared
     with study dated [**3011-3-23**].  The tip of the new endotracheal tube is located at
     the orifice of the right main stem bronchus, with no evidence of left lung
     collapse at this time.  The NG tube is looped in the stomach, with its tip
     extending beyond the film.  A right-sided dual-chamber cardiac pacemaker has
     intact leads with tips projected over the RA and RV apex (in this single
     view), not significantly changed.  The heart size and pulmonary vessels are
     unchanged, with no evidence of CHF and no effusion.  No focal consolidation is
     seen.  Incidentally noted is marked cephalad migration of the humeral head,
     with formation of a pseudoarthrosis with remodeling of the distal acromion and
     clavicle, suggestive of underlying chronic, complete rotator cuff tear.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  ET tube tip in the right mainstem bronchus, which should be withdrawn
     several cm.
     2.  NG tube looped in the stomach with tip not seen.
     3.  No acute cardiopulmonary process and no significant change since the
     [**3011-3-23**] study.
     
     COMMENT:  These findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 8635**] at time of this
     dictation; the ETT has already been partially withdrawn, with f/u study
     ordered.

     AP SUPINE VIEW OF THE CHEST.
     Since the prior study, there has been development of extensive bilateral
     perihilar opacities with air bronchograms, in a ""butterfly"" pattern.  There is
     no pleural effusion. There is no peripheral prominence of interstitial
     marking. The heart, mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  The
     pacemaker leads are in satisfactory position. Endotracheal tube is properly
     positioned at least 5 cm above the carina.  The right-sided CV line projects
     in the mid SVC.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Interval development of new bilateral perihilar airspace disease
     which is suggestive of presence of developing ARDS, or, less likely,
     aspiration pneumonitis. Interval development of heart failure is less
     likely, given the paucity of other findings.
     
     These findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8640**] at the time of dictation.

     SINGLE VIEW OF THE CHEST DATED [**3011-4-15**]
     
     HISTORY:  89-year-old woman, status post line placement; evaluate for
     pneumothorax.
     
     FINDINGS:  Bedside AP examination labeled ""supine, 16:15 hours"" is compared
     with the study obtained approximately one hour earlier.  There has been
     interval partial withdrawal of the ET tube, with tip now 3 cm proximal to the
     carina, and the NG tube remains looped in the stomach with its side-hole in
     the region of the gastric body and tip extending beyond the film.  A new right
     IJ central venous catheter reaches the distal SVC, and there is no supine
     evidence of pneumothorax.  There is linear atelectasis involving the left lung
     base and right mid-lung, but no focal consolidation is seen.  The
     cardiomediastinal silhouette and pulmonary vessels are unchanged.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  ET tube tip now in satisfactory position, with NG tube positioned as
     described.
     2.  Right internal jugular central venous catheter in satisfactory position,
     with no supine evidence of pneumothorax.
     3.  Bibasilar atelectasis, with no other acute cardiopulmonary process.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  89-year-old woman with distended abdomen.  Please evaluate for
     toxic megacolon.
     
     Comparison is made to prior radiograph done on [**3011-3-15**].
     
     ONE RADIOGRAPH OF THE ABDOMEN IN THE SUPINE POSITION:  The NG tube is kinked
     within the stomach.  Note is made of multiple dilated small bowel loops
     measuring up to 3 cm.  Gas is noted within the cecum. There is relative
     paucity of gas within the pelvis, which may relate to presence of rectal tube.
     Complete assessment for presence of air-fluid levels and free intra-abdominal
     air cannot be done on this supine radiograph.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. No evidence of toxic megacolon.
     2. Multiple dilated small bowel loops with no evidence of free intra-
     abdominal air in this supine radiograph.
     3. Relative paucity of the gas within the pelvis, perhaps related to presence
     of the rectal tube.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL HISTORY:  89-year-old female status post ERCP, now with fever,
     hypertension, distended and tender abdomen.  Evaluate for abscess, gallbladder
     pathology.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3011-4-12**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast multidetector CT acquired axial images of the chest,
     abdomen and pelvis from the thoracic inlet to the pubic symphysis.  Coronal
     and sagittal reformatted images were obtained.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST:  Diffuse bilateral peribronchovascular ground-glass opacities
     and bibasilar consolidations are concerning for aspiration pneumonia
     superimposed on early ARDS picture.  There is no pericardial or pleural
     effusion.  Main airways are otherwise patent.  The heart and great vessels are
     unremarkable.  Small mediastinal lymph nodes are present, largest of which is
     a pretracheal node with fatty hilum, measuring approximately 1 cm in the short
     axis.  Heart demonstrates diffuse calcification within the coronary arteries.
     Leads from a dual chamber pacer are seen in standard position.  A column of
     oral contrast is seen within the esophagus extending from the thoracic inlet
     to the stomach. A nasogastric tube is present.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN:  Liver shows no focal lesion.  Gallbladder is somewhat
     distended, however, demonstrates no radiopaque stone or gallbladder wall
     edema. There is probably a small amount pericholecystic fluid.  The adrenal
     glands are bulky, but unchanged in appearance since prior abdominal CT.  There
     is a 3 mm nonobstructing left renal stone.  The right kidney is unremarkable.
     The pancreas is atrophic. The spleen is unremarkable.  A contrast- filled
     distended stomach is present.  The duodenum and proximal jejunum are opacified
     with contrast, however, the remainder of the small bowel remains fluid- filled
     without contrast. The  distal small bowel is decompressed, suggesting partial
     or early small-bowel obstruction, but no definite transition point is
     identified. Diffuse colonic wall thickening and edema consistent with colitis
     is redemonstrated . There is no pneumatosis or free intraperitoneal air. Small
     amount of intra- abdominal free fluid is present.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The rectal tube as well as a
     Foley catheter is seen within the pelvis.  The intrapelvic loops of small
     bowel remain decompressed.  The bladder is collapsed.  Bilateral adnexal
     calcification as well as cystic structure in the right adnexa is unchanged.
                                                                 (Over)

     tuberosities.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Diffuse colitis, which compared to prior CT from [**3011-4-12**], appears
     worse.

     segment, suggestive of early or partial small-bowel obstruction, No definite
     transition point is identified.
     
     3.  Dilated contrast-filled stomach for which NG-tube decompression is
     recommended.
     
     4.  Bilateral diffuse peribronchovascular ground-glass opacity as well as
     consolidation within bilateral lung bases concerning for aspiration pneumonia
     and superimposed developing ARDS.
     
     5.  Distended gallbladder with probable adjacent pericholecystic fluid.
     Bedside sonography may be preformed to evaluate for acute acalculous
     cholecystits, if clinically warranted.

REcieved pt orally intubated and ventilated requieing incraesing ventlaitory and cardiac support. Coomenced midazolam gtt and fentanly. ABG and mixed venous sats poor. Not ventilating therefore increased fi02 and PPEP, with little response, became more hemodynamically unstable, incressed levophed, and started dobuatamine, gave further fluid bolus which saw slight improvement in SBP and o2 sat. However this declined once fluid bolus stopped, started vassopressin and dopamine, again saw slight improvment which was short lived. Many mebers of family came into see Mrs [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) **] all very upset, Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 972**] spoke to them about resusitation ( family updated by attending dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] PCP earlier in the evening and informed of poor prognosis). and said that as she ws on maximum ventilatory and cardiac supoort and that these were not helping, if she were to go in to cardiac arrest then it would be futile to begin CPR as there would be nothing more we could do and she would not make a meaningful recvoery, the family agreed to this. Family present as vital signs deteriroated, told that she her condition was deteriorating, SBP dropping, in paced rhytham, family requested that monitor be left on sp that they could she when she died. FAmily present at time of death. Please see care view for full record of events.
