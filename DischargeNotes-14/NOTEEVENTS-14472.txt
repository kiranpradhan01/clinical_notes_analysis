This is an addendum to the previously dictated discharge
summary up to [**2543-12-28**].

ADDENDUM TO HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2543-12-28**] the
patient's medications were Zosyn, Ciprofloxacin, Fluconazole,
regular insulin sliding scale, amiodarone, Lopresor,
Hydralazine, Lasix, potassium chloride, Colace, Clonidine,
Lactulose, vitamin C, zinc and Ativan.  The patient was
somewhat more agitated and remained in the hospital.  He
remained on pressure support for his ventilatory support.
His abdomen was somewhat distended, so his tube feeds were
held.  His glucose was controlled with his insulin sliding
scale.  He was making adequate urine.  His hematocrit had
dropped somewhat to 26.6 and the patient was transfused one
unit.  His wounds remained clean, dry and intact.

Over the ensuing days the patient's neurological status
returned to his baseline and his ventilatory support was
weaned.  His right chest tube pigtail drain continued to put
out fluid.  On [**1-2**] a left chest tube was placed, which
the patient pulled out on the following day.  Compute
tomography was obtained of the chest, which revealed
bilateral pleural catheters present.  The right loculated
pleural effusion was decreased in size and the left pleural
effusion was stable.  His pericardial effusion was stable.

On the day of discharge [**2544-1-4**], Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] was
afebrile with a temperature max of 98.2, heart rate of 70 and
first degree AV block, blood pressure 139/50 beating 20 times
per minute, sating at 98%, pressure support and CPAP of 10
and 5 with FIO2 of 50%.  He was tolerating tube feeds and had
tolerated 780 cc over the previous 24 hour period.  He
received some intravenous fluids making adequate urine.  His
pigtail drains put out 125 cc.  He was sleeping, but
restless.  Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiac was regular rate and rhythm.  Abdomen was soft,
nondistended, nontender.  Extremities were warm and well
perfuse.  The patient was deemed stable by the cardiothoracic
staff and was discharged to rehabilitation.

     INDICATION: Evaluate for infarction, embolism, hemorrhage, patient with
     diminished neuro status post op.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT.
     
     There is no intra or extra-axial hemorrhage. There is no shift of normally
     midline structures. The ventricles, cisterns and sulci are unremarkable. There
     is calcification within the right vertebral artery. There is hypodensity and
     volume loss in the right temporal lobe indicative of prior infarction. There
     is subtle hypodensity at the genu of the internal capsule on the left.
     A small area of hypodensity is also noted in the left frontal cortex which may
     represent infarction or volume averaging through a sulcus.
     
     The osseous structures and soft tissues are unremarkable. There is mild
     mucosal thickening in the maxillary sinuses bilaterally.
     
     IMPRESSION: Chronic right temporal lobe infarction. Possible infarction at the
     level of the genu of the internal capsule, recommend clinical correlation.
     Left frontal hypodensity may represent infarction, or possible volume
     averaging. If clinical symptoms persist, recommend follow up CT.

     PORTABLE CHEST:
     
     INDICATION: S/P coronary artery bypass surgery. Gram negative rods in sputum.
     
     Comparison is made to previous study of 1 day earlier.
     
     An ETT has been slightly withdrawn in the interval and is now just above the
     thoracic inlet level. A Swan-Ganz catheter is in satisfactory position, and
     bilateral chest tubes and mediastinal drains as well as an NG tube remain in
     place.
     
     The cardiac silhouette is markedly enlarged. There remains vascular
     engorgement and perihilar haziness as well as patchy multifocal alveolar
     opacities with relative sparing of the left apex. Overall, the degree of
     alveolar opacification appears slightly improved when compared to the recent
     study.
     
     No pneumothorax is identified.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1) Proximal location of ETT, approximately 10 cm above the carina.
     This finding was communicated to the clinical service caring for the patient.
     2) Slight improvement in congestive heart failure pattern. It is difficult to
     exclude underlying infection.
     3) Marked enlargement of cardiac silhouette in postoperative period,
     suggesting possible pericardial effusion.

     Reason: pt with decreased PaO2. on vent slow to wean
     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      78 year old man s/p cabg avr
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      pt with decreased PaO2. on vent slow to wean
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATIONS:  Decreased oxygen saturation.
     
     COMPARISONS:  [**2543-12-7**].
     
     FRONTAL CHEST:  S/P sternotomy and AVR.  The endotracheal tube and bilateral
     chest tubes remain well positioned.  A swan-Ganz catheter enters via left
     subclavian access and the tip appears to be at the approximate  level  of the
     pulmonic valve.  The heart remains markedly enlarged.  The bilateral pulmonary
     infiltrates have worsened slightly since the prior study and there is increase
     in retrocardiac opacification.  There is no left sided pleural effusion.  The
     right costophrenic angle is not included on the current study and therefore a
     right pleural effusion is difficult to assess.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Slight interval increase in bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and
     retrocardiac atelectasis consistent with worsening heart failure.
     
     2.  Swan-Ganz catheter tip appears at the approximate level of the pulmonic
     valve.  Otherwise no significant change.

     PORTABLE CHEST, [**2543-12-14**]
     
     INDICATION: Respiratory failure.  High output from effusions.
     
     A densely radiopaque tubing overlies the left trachea.  Endotracheal tube and
     left central venous catheter tips remain in place.  Left and right chest tubes
     remain in place.
     
     The chest shows an increased opacity diffusely over the right lower  lung
     fields consistent with pleural fluid layering.  Pulmonary vessels appear
     stable without significant change.  No other interval findings.  Cardiomegaly
     persists.
     
     Left lateral costophrenic sulcus obscured from view.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     Worsening fluid status with increased right pleural fluid; developing
     infiltrate is possible and needs to be evaluated on followup.

     INDICATION:  Status post feeding tube placement.
     
     FINDINGS:  The tip of the feeding tube is above the diaphragm in the distal
     esophagus.
     
     Bilateral chest tubes are demonstrated and there is no pneumothorax.
     Prominence of interstitial markings and slight patchy area are noted in the
     right lung.  These could be related to congestive features but pneumonia
     cannot be excluded.
     
     IMPRESSION: The feeding tube is not in the appropriate position and needs to
     be positioned more distally.

     PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Comparison is made to study from earlier the
     same day.
     
     ET tube is placed 4 cm above the carina.  Chest tubes are seen at the apex of
     the left and the right lungs.  A nasogastric tube courses beneath the
     diaphragm and off the bottom of the film.  A right subclavian central venous
     catheter terminates in the lower SVC.  CABG clips, skin staples, and suspected
     AVR are seen.
     
     The heart size and mediastinal contours are stable.  Air space opacities in
     the right middle, right lower, and left lower lobes are unchanged.  There
     remain bilateral pleural effusions.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Basically unchanged chest radiograph.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  78 year old man with recent CABG and aortic valve replacement
     with increasing white blood cell count.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous helical images were obtained from the thoracic inlet to
     the pubic symphysis without intravenous contrast.
     
     No prior studies are available for comparison.
     
     CT THORAX WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  No significant axillary, hilar, or mediastinal
     lymphadenopathy.  The patient is status post median sternotomy, CABG, and
     aortic valve replacement.  The heart demonstrates multichamber cardiac
     enlargement.  Surgical changes in the anterior mediastinum are evident.
     Bilateral chest tubes are in place.  There is a moderate right and a small
     left pleural effusion.  There is a moderate pericardial effusion, as well.
     
     Evaluation of the lungs reveals bilateral tiny pneumothoraces.  There is
     bibasilar consolidation with air bronchograms.
     
     CT ABDOMEN:  The liver, spleen, and pancreas are normal.  A tiny non-
     obstructing stone is seen in the left kidney.  A large simple cyst is seen
     exophytic off the mid pole of the left kidney.  The right kidney is
     unremarkable.  There are vascular calcifications throughout.  High density
     within the gallbladder likely represents vicarious excretion of contrast from
     prior procedure.  There is no intraabdominal free fluid or free air.
     Extensive vascular calcifications are noted.  There is no focal fluid
     collection.
     
     CT PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is a single loop of small bowel in the
     right pelvis with diffuse bowel wall thickening.  The remainder of the bowel
     is within normal limits.  There is no pelvic fluid or significant
     lymphadenopathy.  A Foley catheter is seen in the normal-appearing bladder.
     The osseous structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) Bilateral lower lobe pneumonia.

     INDICATION:  RIGHT SUBCLAVIAN LINE PLACEMENT.
     
     Comparison is made to previous study of two days earlier.
     
     A new right subclavian central venous catheter has been placed in the
     interval.  The distal tip is likely in the proximal most portion of the right
     atrium.  A left subclavian central venous catheter terminates at the junction
     of the superior vena cava and right atrium.  An endotracheal tube is in
     satisfactory position.
     
     Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.  There remains vascular engorgement and
     there are asymmetric areas of perihilar haziness, right worse than left.

     INDICATION:  78 year old male status post CABG, respiratory failure requiring
     long-term venous access.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Drs. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3269**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3270**] and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 147**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 346**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3270**], staff
     radiologist, was present throughout the procedure. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 85**] reviewed the
     case.
     
     CONTRAST/MEDICATIONS:  None.
     
     PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:  The procedure was described to the patient's
     family and informed consent was obtained.  Access was gained into the right
     basilic vein using ultrasound as no superficial veins were palpable.
     Sonography of the right basilic vein demonstrates it to be compressible and
     patent.  Using a 21 gauge single wall needle, access was gained and an 0.018
     wire was placed through the needle.  The needle was exchanged for a 5 French
     sheath.  An 0.018 wire was then placed to the level of the cavoatrial
     junction under fluroroscopic guidance, a measurement was obtained, and a 5
     French, double lumen Angiodynamic PICC line was trimmed accordingly and
     inserted through the peel- away sheath, which was simultaneously removed.  An
     xray obtained following placement demonstrates the distal tip of the right
     PICC line to project at the distal superior vena cava.  There is no
     pneumothorax. Multiple tubes and wires are also present.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a 5 French, double lumen Angiodynamics
     catheter via the right basilic vein, with the tip projecting at the distal
     superior vena cava.  The line is ready for immediate use.

     INDICATION:  Status post chest tube pull, rule out pneumothorax.
     
     Portable AP chest radiograph dated [**2543-12-20**] is compared to portable chest
     radiograph dated [**2543-12-5**] and [**2543-12-19**].  There is stable enlargement of the
     cardiac silhouette.  There are sternal wires present and calcification in the
     aortic arch.  There is slightly worsened appearance to the asymmetric
     pulmonary opacities.  The opacities on the right are worst than the left.  in
     comparison to prior films, the patient has had a waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 9763**] appearance
     in the opacities.  This is most likely related to asymmetric pulmonary edema.
     There are bilateral pleural effusions.  The patient's ET tube appears to have
     been replaced with a tracheostomy tube.  A right IJ tip is in appropriate
     position.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1)  Slightly worsened appearance to the bilateral parenchymal
     opacities, which likely represents asymmetric pulmonary edema.
     
     2)  Bilateral small pleural effusions.
     
     3)  Lines and tubes in appropriate position.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     CT OF THE CHEST [**2543-12-22**].
     
     INDICATION:  78 year old male with loculated pleural effusions, increasing
     fever and white count.
     
     Comparison to prior study from [**2543-12-16**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial imaging was performed from the thoracic inlet
     through the upper abdomen without the use of intravenous contrast.
     
     CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  There is a large, loculated right pleural effusion
     containing multiple small foci of gas, similar to appearances to that seen on
     the prior study (though the gas was not visualized at that time).  A second
     loculated component is seen superior and lateral to this, which has increased
     in size when compared to the prior study.  This was along the path of the
     previously present chest tube.  There is also a moderate left-sided pleural
     effusion which has increased in size when compared to the prior study.
     Consolidated lung is seen adjacent to the pleural effusions bilaterally which
     may represent atelectasis and/or pneumonia.  The tracheobronchial tree appears
     within normal limits.  An endotracheal tube terminates approximately 5 cm
     above the carina.  Multiple mediastinal lymph nodes are again identified,
     including a 12-mm right paratracheal node.  The aorta is heavily calcified.
     Again noted is a moderate-to-large pericardial effusion, containing high-
     density material suggesting blood.  Limited view of the upper abdomen
     demonstrates a large exophytic cyst in the left kidney.  Degenerative changes
     are seen throughout the spine.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) Bilateral pleural effusions, loculated on the right.  The larger component
     contains some gas which may be residua of previous intervention, though
     infected collection cannot be excluded.  The left-sided effusion has increased
     in size and adjacent consolidation may represent atelectasis and/or pneumonia.
     
     2) Persistent moderate-to-large pericardial effusion with high-density
     material suggesting blood.

     INDICATION:  Right-sided loculated effusion status post CABG and AVR,
     increasing white count and fever.
     
     Patient is unable to give consent.  Procedure and associated risks are
     discussed with patient's son, [**Known patient firstname 602**] [**Known patient lastname 7205**], and telephone witnessed
     consent is obtained.
     
     LIMITED CT CHEST FOR GUIDANCE OF DRAIN PLACEMENT:  Patient is placed in a left
     lateral decubitus position and initial CT demonstrates large loculated right-
     sided posterior pleural effusion with punctate air not significantly changed
     from previous CT of [**2543-12-22**].  A small left-sided pleural effusion is also
     demonstrated.  Appropriate position for drainage of the right-sided pleural
     effusion is determined.
     
     CT-GUIDED ASPIRATION:  The posterior right thorax was sterile prepped and
     draped in the usual fashion.  3 cc 1% buffered lidocaine administered
     subcutaneously to provide local anesthesia.  Under CT guidance, an 8-French
     locking pigtail [**Last Name (un) 5166**] catheter is positioned within the loculated right
     pleural effusion and 20 cc straw-colored fluid is aspirated.
     
     CT-GUIDED DRAIN PLACEMENT:  CT fluoroscopy is used to demonstrate appropriate
     positioning of locking 8-French [**Last Name (un) 5166**] catheter within loculated right
     pleural effusion.  Drainage catheter is attached to bag to drain to gravity.
     Aspirated fluid is delivered to laboratory for microbiological assessment.
     There are no immediate complications and the patient tolerated the procedure
     well.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful aspiration and drain placement for right loculated
     pleural effusion.

     The spleen, pancreas are unremarkable.  Scattered calcifications are
     identified along the splenic artery.
     
     There is neither mesenteric nor retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  There is no
     abdominal free fluid.
     
     A G tube is in appropriate position.  Normal opacified loops of small and
     large bowel are identified.
     
     Both kidneys are of normal size and attenuation without evidence for
     hydronephrosis.  Scattered calcifications are identified within the hilar
     region of the left kidney consistent with avascular origin.  An approximately
     8 cm simple cyst is identified emanating from the interpole region of the left
     kidney.
     
     CT PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST:  The urinary bladder is unremarkable.  A Foley
     catheter is in place.  There is no pelvic free fluid.  Note is made of
     bilateral fat-containing inguinal hernias.  Calcifications are noted within
     the internal iliac arteries bilaterally.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  Neither destructive lytic lesions nor fractures are identified.
     CT GUIDED ASPIRATION:  With the patient placed in the right side down
     decubitus position, a radiopaque grid was placed over the left lateral thorax.
      Limited CT images of the mid to lower left thorax were obtained.  A site for
     appropriate pleural aspiration was marked.
     
     Prior to performing the procedure, informed verbal consent was obtained from
     the patient's son, his health care proxy.  All raised questions were answered.
     
     CT Localization:  CT was utilized to identify an appropriate location and
     direction for pigtail catheter placement. The patient's skin was cleansed with
     betadine. A sterile field was erected. Approximately 4 cc of 1% Lidocaine were
     infused into the skin surface.  With CT fluoro guidance, a spinal needle was
     inserted into the left pleural collection. Approximately 3 cc of a straw
     colored fluid were obtained and sent for culture.
     
     CT GUIDED DRAIN PLACEMENT:  With CT fluoroscopy, an 8 French [**Last Name (un) 5107**] catheter
     was inserted into the pleural collection.  Following aspiration of fluid, the
     spinal needle was removed.  The pig-tail portion of the catheter was engaged.
     The catheter was secured to the patient's skin.  A drainage bag was attached
     to the catheter to drain to gravity.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  78 y/o man status post CABG with respiratory failure.  Left
     pleural effusion.  Elevated white count.
     
     COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from 1/26/200.  Chest CT from [**2543-12-22**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous helical images of the chest, abdomen and pelvis were
     obtained without IV contrast.
     
     Following the acquisition of the preliminary images, CT fluoro was utilized
     for localization and guidance of catheter placement.
     
     CONTRAST: None.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9771**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9772**].  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 9771**], staff
     radiologist, was present for the entirety of the procedure and supervised Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 9772**].
     
     CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST:
     
     The patient is status post sternotomy.  Intact midline sternal wires are
     identified.  A tracheostomy tube is in place with its below the thoracic
     inlet.  A right sided central line is in place with tip terminating within the
     distal SVC.
     
     Calcifications are identified within the thoracic aorta as well as the
     coronary arteries.  A paracardial effusion with scattered areas of high
     attenuation is identified.  Non pathologically enlarged mediastinal lymph
     nodes are identified.  There is neither hilar nor axillary lymphadenopathy.
     
     Bilateral pleural effusions are present.  There has been interval removal of
     the right sided tube that was placed 6 days ago.  Bilateral lower lobe
     consolidation is present.  There are no pneumothoraces.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST:  The liver is of normal size and attenuation
     without focal lesions or intraparenchymal biliary duct dilation.  The
     gallbladde is slightly distended with a contrast fluid level present
     consistent with vicarious excretion of contrast.  There is no gallbladder wall
                                                                 (Over)

     The spleen, pancreas are unremarkable.  Scattered calcifications are
     identified along the splenic artery.
     
     There is neither mesenteric nor retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  There is no
     abdominal free fluid.
     
     A G tube is in appropriate position.  Normal opacified loops of small and
     large bowel are identified.
     
     Both kidneys are of normal size and attenuation without evidence for
     hydronephrosis.  Scattered calcifications are identified within the hilar
     region of the left kidney consistent with avascular origin.  An approximately
     8 cm simple cyst is identified emanating from the interpole region of the left
     kidney.
     
     CT PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST:  The urinary bladder is unremarkable.  A Foley
     catheter is in place.  There is no pelvic free fluid.  Note is made of
     bilateral fat-containing inguinal hernias.  Calcifications are noted within
     the internal iliac arteries bilaterally.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  Neither destructive lytic lesions nor fractures are identified.
     CT GUIDED ASPIRATION:  With the patient placed in the right side down
     decubitus position, a radiopaque grid was placed over the left lateral thorax.
      Limited CT images of the mid to lower left thorax were obtained.  A site for
     appropriate pleural aspiration was marked.
     
     Prior to performing the procedure, informed verbal consent was obtained from
     the patient's son, his health care proxy.  All raised questions were answered.
     
     CT Localization:  CT was utilized to identify an appropriate location and
     direction for pigtail catheter placement. The patient's skin was cleansed with
     betadine. A sterile field was erected. Approximately 4 cc of 1% Lidocaine were
     infused into the skin surface.  With CT fluoro guidance, a spinal needle was
     inserted into the left pleural collection. Approximately 3 cc of a straw
     colored fluid were obtained and sent for culture.
     
     CT GUIDED DRAIN PLACEMENT:  With CT fluoroscopy, an 8 French [**Last Name (un) 5107**] catheter
     was inserted into the pleural collection.  Following aspiration of fluid, the
     spinal needle was removed.  The pig-tail portion of the catheter was engaged.
     The catheter was secured to the patient's skin.  A drainage bag was attached
     to the catheter to drain to gravity.
                                                                 (Over)

     CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST:
     
     The patient is status post sternotomy.  Intact midline sternal wires are
     identified.  A tracheostomy tube is in place with its below the thoracic
     inlet.  A right sided central line is in place with tip terminating within the
     distal SVC.
     
     Calcifications are identified within the thoracic aorta as well as the
     coronary arteries.  A paracardial effusion with scattered areas of high
     attenuation is identified.  Non pathologically enlarged mediastinal lymph
     nodes are identified.  There is neither hilar nor axillary lymphadenopathy.
     
     Bilateral pleural effusions are present.  There has been interval removal of
     the right sided tube that was placed 6 days ago.  Bilateral lower lobe
     consolidation is present.  There are no pneumothoraces.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST:  The liver is of normal size and attenuation
     without focal lesions or intraparenchymal biliary duct dilation.  The
     gallbladde is slightly distended with a contrast fluid level present
     consistent with vicarious excretion of contrast.  There is no gallbladder wall

     The spleen, pancreas are unremarkable.  Scattered calcifications are
     identified along the splenic artery.
     
     There is neither mesenteric nor retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  There is no
     abdominal free fluid.
     
     A G tube is in appropriate position.  Normal opacified loops of small and
     large bowel are identified.
     
     Both kidneys are of normal size and attenuation without evidence for
     hydronephrosis.  Scattered calcifications are identified within the hilar
     region of the left kidney consistent with avascular origin.  An approximately
     8 cm simple cyst is identified emanating from the interpole region of the left
     kidney.
     
     CT PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST:  The urinary bladder is unremarkable.  A Foley
     catheter is in place.  There is no pelvic free fluid.  Note is made of
     bilateral fat-containing inguinal hernias.  Calcifications are noted within
     the internal iliac arteries bilaterally.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  Neither destructive lytic lesions nor fractures are identified.
     CT GUIDED ASPIRATION:  With the patient placed in the right side down
     decubitus position, a radiopaque grid was placed over the left lateral thorax.
      Limited CT images of the mid to lower left thorax were obtained.  A site for
     appropriate pleural aspiration was marked.
     
     Prior to performing the procedure, informed verbal consent was obtained from
     the patient's son, his health care proxy.  All raised questions were answered.
     
     CT Localization:  CT was utilized to identify an appropriate location and
     direction for pigtail catheter placement. The patient's skin was cleansed with
     betadine. A sterile field was erected. Approximately 4 cc of 1% Lidocaine were
     infused into the skin surface.  With CT fluoro guidance, a spinal needle was
     inserted into the left pleural collection. Approximately 3 cc of a straw
     colored fluid were obtained and sent for culture.
     
     CT GUIDED DRAIN PLACEMENT:  With CT fluoroscopy, an 8 French [**Last Name (un) 5107**] catheter
     was inserted into the pleural collection.  Following aspiration of fluid, the
     spinal needle was removed.  The pig-tail portion of the catheter was engaged.
     The catheter was secured to the patient's skin.  A drainage bag was attached
     to the catheter to drain to gravity.
                                                                 (Over)

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      78 year old man with CABG complicated by infected pleural effusions, resp
      failure, renal failure.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Bilateral pleural effusions with multiple organisms, not improving on abx. Had
      right pigtail catheter placed [**12-22**], which patient self d/c'ed. After several
      days without catheter, he is not improving. Please replace right pigtail chest
      catheter.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Bilateral empyemas.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous helical images of the thorax were obtained with iv
     contrast.  This was followed by placement of a pleural drainage catheter under
     CT fluoro guidance.
     
     PRELIMINARY CHEST CT:  The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus
     position.  Again seen, are moderate loculated effusions on the right.  A
     drainage catheter enters the left thorax and is coiled within the pleural
     space.  The left pleural effusion has decreased in size since [**2541-12-27**].  There
     is associated  bibasilar atelectasis/consolidation.  There is a stable
     pericardial effusion.  There is stable multichamber cardiac enlargement.  A
     tracheostomy tube is in position.
     
     CT LOCALIZED DRAINAGE: Informed consent was obtained by telephone from the
     patient's son.  Limited axial ct images were obtained to localize the right
     loculated pleural fluid collection to be drained.  Images were obtained using
     localizing grid.
     
     CT GUIDANCE DRAINAGE.  CT fluoroscopy was used for guidance of a 25 gauge
     needle into the pleural fluid collection.
     
     CT GUIDED FLUID ASPIRATION:  Using the 25 gauge needle, a small aspirate was
     obtained.  Approximately 10 cc of cloudy, yellow fluid was obtained and sent
     to the laboratory for analysis.
     
     CT GUIDED CATHETER INSERTION:  A 12 French self-locking pigtail catheter was
     inserted and deployed into the fluid collection under direct CT fluoroscopic
     guidance.  Catheter position was again confirmed by CT.  The catheter was
     locked in position and secured to the skin with a percutaneous catheter
     fastener and attached to gravity drainage.
     
     CONSCIOUS SEDATION:  Patient received 1 mg of Versed and 25 mg Fentinyl iv and
     was consciously monitored by a registered nurse for the remainder of the
     procedure.  There were no immediate complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Uncomplicated placement of 12 French pigtail catheter into right
     pleural fluid collection.
                                                                 (Over)

     Comparison made to study of [**2543-12-30**].
     
     PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: A right sided pigtail pleural catheter and right
     sided chest tube have been placed. The tip of the chest tube overlies the
     mid lung zone and the tip of the pigtail catheter is located medially in the
     lower lung zones. A tracheostomy tube terminates 5.5 cm above the carina.
     Position of the left pigtail catheter is unchanged.
     
     The heart size and mediastinal contours are stable. Left sided pleural
     effusion is unchanged. The loculated aspects of the right sided pleural
     effusion are slightly increased in size. There is improvement in the dependent
     portion of the right sided pleural effusion. Pulmonary vessels are indistinct
     and engorged.  No pneumothorax is identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) Placement of right sided chest and pigtail catheter with some improvement
     of the dependent aspects of the right sided pleural effusion.  The loculated
     aspect of this effusion laterally is unchanged.
     
     2) Continued left heart failure.

     INDICATION:  Bilateral empyemas.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous helical images of the thorax were obtained with iv
     contrast.  This was followed by placement of a pleural drainage catheter under
     CT fluoro guidance.
     
     PRELIMINARY CHEST CT:  The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus
     position.  Again seen, are moderate loculated effusions on the right.  A
     drainage catheter enters the left thorax and is coiled within the pleural
     space.  The left pleural effusion has decreased in size since [**2541-12-27**].  There
     is associated  bibasilar atelectasis/consolidation.  There is a stable
     pericardial effusion.  There is stable multichamber cardiac enlargement.  A
     tracheostomy tube is in position.
     
     CT LOCALIZED DRAINAGE: Informed consent was obtained by telephone from the
     patient's son.  Limited axial ct images were obtained to localize the right
     loculated pleural fluid collection to be drained.  Images were obtained using
     localizing grid.
     
     CT GUIDANCE DRAINAGE.  CT fluoroscopy was used for guidance of a 25 gauge
     needle into the pleural fluid collection.
     
     CT GUIDED FLUID ASPIRATION:  Using the 25 gauge needle, a small aspirate was
     obtained.  Approximately 10 cc of cloudy, yellow fluid was obtained and sent

     CT thorax [**2544-1-2**] compared to one day earlier.
     
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  78 year old male status post coronary artery bypass
     surgery with bilateral pleural effusions and increasing white blood cell
     count.  The patient removed chest tube this morning.  CT is requested to
     further evaluate pleural collections.
     
     A pigtail pleural catheter that was placed yesterday remains in place within
     the lower right hemithorax in the posterior costophrenic sulcus region.  Since
     the previous pre-pigtail pleural catheter images of one day earlier, the
     posterior loculated collection has significantly decreased in size in the
     interval.  Note is also made of a persistent left-sided pigtail pleural
     catheter also located posteriorly in the costophrenic sulcus region.  There
     are small residual pleural effusions bilaterally.  The right effusion
     demonstrates multiple small loculated components apically and laterally.  An
     apical medial loculated component present on the previous study has resolved
     in the interval.  Small lateral loculated components are slightly improved in
     the upper right hemithorax and without significant interval change in the mid
     and lower hemithorax.  The left pleural effusion is mostly dependent in
     location and has a similar overall appearance to one day earlier with perhaps
     minimal increase in amount of fluid between the two studies.  Note is again
     made of a moderate-to-large pericardial effusion, stable in size.  Soft-tissue
     stranding within the mediastinal fat is also stable in the interval.  A small
     retrosternal fluid collection appears contiguous with the pericardial space
     and is stable.
     
     Imaging of the uppermost portion of the abdomen demonstrates streak artifact
     from barium within the GI tract.  The imaged portions of the liver and spleen
     are unremarkable.  A large exophytic cyst in the left kidney is incompletely
     imaged on this study and cannot be fully assessed.
     
     Review of the lungs reveals limited assessment due to extensive respiratory
     motion.  Apparent ground glass opacities in the lungs are likely mostly
     related to extensive expiratory phase of respiration.  There are some
     thickened septal lines and minimal areas of patchy consolidation and true
     ground glass opacity which may reflect a component of heart failure.
     Opacities immediately adjacent to pleural fluid probably reflect atelectasis,
     although an infectious process is not excluded.
     
     Degenerative changes are observed within the spine.  Note is made of median
                                                                 (Over)

     A tracheostomy tube is in place in satisfactory position.  Note is also made
     of a right PICC line, which courses into the right atrium on the scout view.
     It is difficult to follow the catheter on the axial images due to obscuration
     by intravenous contrast.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) Bilateral pigtail pleural catheters are present in the lower hemithorax
     posteriorly within dependent pleural collections.  The right loculated pleural
     fluid collection posteriorly has significantly decreased in size since
     placement of the right-sided pigtail catheter.  The left pleural fluid
     collection appears similar to minimally increased from the prior study of one
     day earlier.
     
     2) Stable pericardial effusion.
     
     3) Findings suggestive of mild congestive heart failure.
     
     4) Basilar opacities adjacent to the pleural fluid collections likely reflect
     atelectasis but infection is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
     
     5) Appropriate positioning of tracheostomy tube, but cuff of the tube appears
     over-distended.

     an irregular appearance with tertiary contractions. No fistula was
     demonstrated. There is no evidence of diverticulum or stricture. Correlation
     with chest CT done immediately after fluoroscopy shows no unexplained

                                     FINAL REPORT
     PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH OF [**2544-1-12**]:
     
     HISTORY:  Status post bleeding from a right pig-tail chest drain.  Low
     hematocrit.
     
     FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to a previous exam of [**2544-1-1**].  Again seen are
     bilateral pig-tail catheters overlying the lower lung zones, unchanged from
     the previous exam.  The heart is enlarged.  There has been interval
     development of a large area of white-out within the right middle and lower
     lobes.  This is markedly increased from the previous exam.  Again seen is a
     probable loculated collection of fluid of the right upper lateral hemithorax,
     unchanged from the previous exam.  The left lung is essentially unchanged.
     There still appears to be a mild degree of collapse/consolidation (effusion
     cannot be excluded) within the retrocardiac region on the left.  Median
     sternotomy wires, surgical clips and tracheostomy are again seen.  The soft
     tissue and osseous structures are unchanged.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Significant interval increase in probable effusion/fluid collection within
     the right middle and lower lobes.  An underlying pneumonic consolidation vs.
     infection cannot be excluded on this single film.
     2)  Bilateral pig-tail catheters, unchanged in position from the previous
     exam.  Interval removal of right-sided chest tube.
     3)  Persistent cardiomegaly, with findings suggestive of congestive heart
     failure.
     4)  Interval placement of a left-sided central venous catheter, with tip
     overlying the distal left brachiocephalic vein.

      increasing WBC. s/p AVR
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      78 yo with pigtail cath in left and right hemithorax; now with sanguinous
      drainage from R pigtail cath; hct 17. please evaluate for blood in thorax
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY: Status post bilateral pigtail catheters of the chest, now with
     drainage from the right pigtail catheter, dropping hematocrit. Evaluate for
     blood in the thorax.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     thoracic inlet to the lung bases without the administration of IV contrast.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Comparison is made to a contrast enhanced
     CT of the chest [**2544-1-2**]. Soft tissue windows demonstrate a significant
     interval increase in the amount of mixed low attenuation/soft tissue density
     attenuation fluid within the right hemithorax, predominantly within the mid
     and lower lung zones. Again seen are bilateral pigtail catheters, within the
     posterior/inferior portions of the hemithoraces. There is a persistent
     moderate sized pericardial effusion. There has also been an increase in the
     amount of pleural fluid at the right lung apex. There has been a slight
     interval increase in the amount of pleural fluid within the dependent portion
     of the left hemithorax. Inflammatory changes are again seen within the
     mediastinum as well as a small substernal fluid collection that appears
     contiguous with the pericardium. Also noted is a very small fluid collection
     with adjacent inflammatory changes of the right lateral subcutaneous tissues,
     between the 6th and 7th right lateral ribs.
     
     Lung windows demonstrate no significant change since the previous exam, with
     some thickened septal lines and minimal areas of patchy consolidation. The
     opacities immediately adjacent to the pleural fluid again likely represents
     atelectasis.
     
     Bone windows demonstrate no significant changes since the previous exam.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. Significant interval increase in the amount of mixed simple fluid and
     probable acute blood within the right hemithorax, as described above.
     Bilateral pigtail catheters not changed in position.
     2. Persistent moderate-sized pericardial effusion.
     3. Persistent small substernal fluid collection, which appears contiguous with
     the pericardial space.
     4. Slight interval increase in amount of pleural fluid within the left
     hemithorax.
     
     The above findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) **] the time of the examination.
                                                                 (Over)

     INDICATION:  Question pneumothorax or effusion.
     
     FINDINGS:  Tracheostomy tube is satisfactory.  A left subclavian line is seen,
     the tip is in the mid SVC.  Allowing for the projection the heart size is
     normal.  There are bilateral pulmonary infiltrates with loss of the
     hemidiaphragms on both sides.  The appearances are not significantly changed
     compared to the prior study.  This appearance may be due to ARDS, extensive
     pulmonary edema or bilateral infections, but this is considered less likely.
     Additionally there are likely bibasal pleural effusions.
     
     Chest drain seen in the right hemithorax.  No pneumothorax identified.
