Admission Date:  [**2852-7-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2852-7-10**]
 
Date of Birth:  [**2780-3-28**]             Sex:   M
 
Service: CARDIOTHORACIC
 
Allergies: 
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs
 
Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 807**] 
Chief Complaint:
Myocardial infarction
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Placement of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuit and 
cannulae in the catheterization laboratory.
2. Emergent coronary artery bypass grafting x3 with the 
saphenous vein grafts to the marginal artery, left anterior 
descending artery and right coronary artery.
3. Placement of Abiomed BVS 5000 left ventricular assist device.
4. Bilateral groin exploration with repair of arterial and 
venous puncture sites.
5. Exploration, evacuation of hematoma
6. Exploratory laparotomy, left colectomy

 
History of Present Illness:
This is a 72-year-old male who had a h/o coronary artery disease 
and underwent a left anterior descending artery stent about a 
month ago. He persisted in
having chest pains and he was brought back to the 
catheterization lab in an attempt to angioplasty his left 
anterior descending artery as well as his right coronary artery. 
During his catheterization, he developed a clot in his left main 
and left anterior descending artery. He went into ventricular 
tachycardia and arrested. Chest compressions were initiated. CT 
surgery was called down to the catheterization lab where we set 
up an ECMO circuit and reinserted a 15-French cannula in the 
right femoral artery percutaneously followed by a 24-French 
venous cannula up to the right femoral vein percutaneously. The 
ECMO was initiated and we stopped chest compressions. We then 
brought him to the
operating room emergently for a coronary artery bypass grafting 
and a possible left ventricular assist device placement. We had 
discussed the risks and benefits with his daughter, who agreed 
with us to proceed.
 
Past Medical History:
Hypercholesterolemia, HTN, CAD s/p LAD stenting [**5-21**], severe 
COPD, pituitary disorder, carotid a. dz s/p L CEA 2003, ?h/o 
TIA, BPH, herpes
PSH: L CEA, orchiectomy age 16 after trauma, R arm injury, b/l 
cataract surgery

 
Social History:
Patient is married with three adult children. He previously was 
a truck driver. 
 
Family History:
No h/o CAD

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2852-7-5**], Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] was admitted to the cardiac surgery service 
under the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] following an emergent CABG. For 
details of the operation please see Dr.[**Doctor Last Name 11514**] operative 
report. Post-operatively Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] had a very complicated course. 
He was in critical condition from the start. He was cared for in 
the CSRU with a left ventricular assist device. He underwent an 
exploratory laparotomy on [**7-8**] with resection of his left colon 
secondary to ischemic colitis. Mr. [**Known patient lastname 11515**] cardiovascular status 
never recovered from the initial infarct, and required 
defibrillation multiple times throughout the course of his ICU 
stay. On [**2852-7-10**], after long discussion with family members, it 
was decided to make him comfort measures only. He expired at 
2:35 pm.

     Nasogastric tube is coursing down below the left hemidiaphragm.  There is two
     mediastinal tubes and one mediastinal drain. Superior mediastinum is somewhat
     widened, which may be due to positioning or postoperative change.  There is
     bilateral pleural effusion.  There is increased interstitial markings
     bilaterally.  No evidence of pneumothorax is noted.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Tubes and lines as expected.  Somewhat widened superior

     mediastinal tube and a drain into the mediastinum seen.  A nasogastric tube is
     present with the tip in the stomach.  A left subclavian line is present with
     the tip at the junction of the left innominate and SVC.
     
     Cardiac size is not enlarged.  No failure or infiltrate is seen.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No failure.  No infiltrates.  Dialysis catheter tip at junction

Neuro: Propofol increased from 30-40 mcq/kg/min when it was noted that pt. moved hands and was shaking head side to side. He did not follow commands when asked simple questions. Pt. synchronized with vent; occ. spont. resp noted prior to propofol increase. 

CV: Pt. completely in av-paced rhythm No problems with [**Name2 (NI) 583**]. LVAD with flows >5 L and beat rate 55-60. PAD ~29 and CVP ~22. Occ. drifts in CO to 4l/min but resolved within several minutes. SVO2 ~62%. Requiring increase in Levophed to .1mcq/kg for SBP's 88-90. See flowsheet for other drips and doses. Anticoagulation started for LVAD with heparin infusion. Started at 600u/hr and up to 800u when ACT 160's. PTT up to 92 with morning labs but ACT 202. Heparin cutback to 600u/hr.

GI: Tol OGT clamping for meds. Protonix IV q24. No bowel sounds; bladder pressures [**11-27**]. 

GU: huo 25-40. May start CVVHD in the next couple of days.,No Lasix per renal.

Integ: Chest open and draped in sterile dsg. Left fem site oozes blood.JP from ant. chest wound on intermittent sx. Right fem site stable. Pt. is Extremely edematous. Blisters on lower extr. along incisions; compression sleeves on. 

Heme: Hct 28.6. Plts improving. Heparin for anticoagulation of LVAD.

Plan: hemodynamic stability in order to wean VAD in the next few days. Optimize oxygenation. Renal consult for CVVHD. Monitor for infection (temp)/ WBC,

     PORTABLE CHEST [**7-9**]:
     
     INDICATION:  Postop cardiac surgery.  Check wire placement.
     
     FINDINGS:  Compared with [**2852-7-8**], the tip of the Swan-Ganz catheter has been
     withdrawn to the level of the right atrium.  A right subclavian central venous
     line is now present with its tip at the mid SVC level.
     
     There appears to be a small right basal pneumothorax with the patient supine.
     This appears smaller than on a prior chest x-ray from [**7-7**].  No significant
     atelectasis of the underlying right lung.
     
     The CHF appears to have essentially cleared.
     
     On several of the patient's recent postop portable studies, there is a
     somewhat irregular poorly defined, approximately 2 cm rounded density
     overlying the right lung apex.  This may be related to calcification of the
     first costochondral junction, but on the film of 7/23, it may project over the
     first anterior interspace rather than related to the first rib.  This should
     be compared with any available preop films, and/or formal PA/lateral views
     should be obtained when the patient's clinical condition permits.
     
     IMPRESSION: Tubes and lines as above.
     
     Persistent but smaller pneumothorax at the right base.
     
     Poorly defined density at the right apex.  Please see recommendations above.
     
     Findings discussed with the surgical PA.
