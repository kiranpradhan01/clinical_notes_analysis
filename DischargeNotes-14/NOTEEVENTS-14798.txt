      thickened gallbladder wall without stones, gallbladder
      distention or pericholecystic fluid, a finding which is commonly seen in HIV
      patients; HIV is the most likely etiology, but acute chole cannot be
      definitively excluded
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL HISTORY:  48-year-old female with HIV and one week history of right
     upper quadrant and epigastric pain.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Right upper quadrant ultrasound.
     
     COMPARISON:  None available.
     
     FINDINGS:  The liver demonstrates no focal or textural abnormalities.  There
     is no intrahepatic or extrahepatic ductal dilatation.  The common bile duct
     measures 3 cm in diameter.  The portal vein demonstrates normal color flow.
     There is circumferential thickening of the gallbladder wall, which measures up
     to 6 mm in thickness.  No definite wall edema or pericholecystic fluid is
     identified.  There are no stones or sludge.  There is no ascites.
     
     IMPRESSION: Circumferential thickening of the gallbladder wall without
     evidence of stones, gallbladder distension, or pericholecystic fluid.
     Gallbladder wall thickening is a common finding in HIV patients, and is the
     most likely etiology of this finding.  Acute cholecystitis cannot be excluded
     in the appropriate clinical setting.  Correlation with a clinical exam is
     recommended.

Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs
 
Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10174**] 
Chief Complaint:
fever, petechial rash
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

 
History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 48 yo woman w/ a hx of HIV/AIDS (CD4=79, [**9-29**]), chronic 
DIC, asthma and chronic HCV infection who presents with a 
subjective fever x 2 wks and petechial rash of 2 days duration. 
Pt was in her usual state of health until 2 weeks prior to 
admission, at which time she developed fever and night sweats. 
She noticed the fever would be worse at nights and resolve 
during the days. This was treated symptomatically with aspirin.  
One week prior to admission, she developed non-bloody diarrhea, 
for which she was seen by her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 1110**] episode of diarrhea 
resolved with Imodium several days before admission. On the day 
before presentation to the ED, she developed a diffuse petechial 
rash on her lower extremities bilaterally extending proximally 
to the knees. The rash was accompanied by edema and pruritis 
over both lower extremities. She reports worsening of her fever 
and persistence of the rash over the subsequent 24 hour period, 
leading to her presentation to the ED for evaluation. On 
presentation, she also c/o focal pain in her right upper 
quadrant on moderate palpation that started around the same time 
as her diarrhea, but has persisted. On review, she denies cough, 
N/V, current diarrhea, rhinorrhea, chest pain and neck pain. Her 
boyfriend has a cough that has persisted for the past 1 month, 
but has not sought medical care. She denies other sick contacts, 
recent travel, change in medication.
 
Past Medical History:
1. AIDS - diagnosed 12 years ago. Her most recent CD4 = 79 
([**2585-10-7**] per report). Pt was started on HAART at [**Hospital1 717**], which was 
self-discontinued for the past 1 year secondary to side effects 
(stiffness in lower extremities). She has since transferred care 
to her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 5552**] has not restarted therapy
2. HCV - Increased AFP w/ negative MRI liver [**4-28**], with some 
evidence of portal htn on abd u/s per report. She has since 
refused treatment and liver bx.
3. Asthma/COPD
4. Pancytopenia
5. Depression
6. Substance abuse (cocaine, EtOH)
 
Social History:
Pt currently lives in home with her boyfriend of 16 years and 
his son. She has two sons from a previous relationship. She has 
recent cocaine and heavy alcohol use over the holidays (most 
recent two days ago), but reports no IVDU and otherwise 
occassional drinking (3-4 beers on weekends only). She smokes 
0-1 cigarettes a day with a past hx of smoking.
 
Family History:
Notable for hx of diabetes in mother and heart disease in 
brother, but reports no family hx of cancer.

Pertinent Results:
[**2585-11-28**] - On admission, WBC: 2.0, Hct: 26.0, Plt: 88, with a 
white ct differntial of 65 N, 14 Bands, 25 Lymphs. Significant 
chemistry results include Cl: 114, Ca: 8.1, Albumin: 2.4, ALT: 
,but otherwise within normal limits. Coagulation labs of note 
include fibrinogen: 68 and D-Dimer: 2595. </p>

A lumbar puncture in the ED was within normal limits, with 
negative AFB, gram stain and culture. A urine sample 
demonstrated moderate blood, but otherwise nl chemistry and 
negative culture. Serum studies notable for negative HBV, 
negative EBV, negative CMV, negative AFB, negative gon / chl and 
negative blood cultures.</p>

Induced sputum obtained over three days was negative for AFB and 
PCP. </p>

A chest CT was notable for mediastinal LAD (subchorinal, 
prechorinal nodes)relatively unchanged since previous scan in 
[**1-27**], retroperitoneal LAD, ascites and few, spotty ground-glass 
appearing opacities.  Abdominal and pelvic CT confirmed the 
presence of retroperitoneal LAD and ascites. </p>
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Following admission to medicine, infectious etiologies of fever 
were studied in the context of her shortness of breath, recent 
hx of diarrhea and LE petechial rash. Induced sputum, serum and 
urine cultures taken at admission yielded no growth. Cultures 
for OI in the setting of HIV were taken and prophylaxis for MAC 
and PCP were administered. Broad spectrum abx were administered, 
given her shortness of breath and risk factors for CAP. In the 
setting of fever and RUQ pain, a RUQ U/S demonstrated 
symmetrical gall bladder wall thickening at 6 mm, which was 
confirmed on HIDA. However, no acute cholecystitis was detected 
and her abdominal tenderness abated over the next day.  A 
surface echo with negative blood cx ruled out endocarditis as a 
source of the rash and fever. Chest, abdominal and pelvic CTs 
were then obtained to evaluate soft tissue masses given her hx 
of mediastinal LAD from a previous study at [**Hospital1 717**] in 3/04.  The pt 
had persistence of a subchorinal node and prechorinal node, 
measuring at approximately the same size as the nodes on her 
previous study.  Several enlarged retroperitoneal lymph[**MD Number 285**] at 
the level of her kidneys and ascites were also noted on CT. Over 
the subsequent three days, the pt's rash gradually improved, 
though her fevers and night sweats persisted.  Blood cx were 
obtained during night fever spikes for culture and no organisms 
were cultured.  She demonstrated features of chronic DIC, with 
low platelets and elevated FDPs and d-dimer, probably secondary 
to her underlying chronic HCV.  The rest of her pancytopenic 
features were felt to be due to her advanced HIV disease, as a 
prior bone marrow biopsy had not shown other pathology.  These 
factors were the likely cause of her lower extremity 
petechiae.</p>

An infectious disease consultation was obtained to further 
determine whether biopsy of enlarged lymph[**MD Number 285**] would be 
desireable. A decision was made in consultation with the patient 
not to pursue biopsy of nodes, on the basis of their difficulty 
to approach with minimal invasiveness and the patient's 
desire.</p>

Following improvement of the petechial rash and culturing for a 
source of fever, patient was discharged home with ID and PCP 
[**Name9 (PRE) 2271**] of results.

     adenopathy with recurrent fevers.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  CT imaging of the chest performed after the intravenous
     administration of 100 mL of Optiray.  Nonionic contrast was used due to
     patient debility.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  Several axillary lymph nodes are seen.  The
     largest of which measures 9 mm in short axis.  Soft tissue density is seen
     within the subcarinal region suggestive of lymphadenopathy measuring 2.2 x 1.1
     cm. Additional enlarged lymph nodes in the precarinal region measure 1.8 x 1.2
     cm. Smaller borderline lymph nodes are present in the prevascular space and
     paratracheal region.  No pathologically enlarged hilar lymph nodes are seen.
     
     No pericardial or pleural effusions are seen.  Scattered areas of peripheral
     ground-glass opacity are seen within both lungs.  These are best seen on
     series 3 images 43 within the right lower lobe, within series 3 image 20
     within the left upper lobe, as well as within series 3 image 49 within the
     peripheral left lower lobe.  No pulmonary nodules or areas of pulmonary
     parenchymal consolidation are seen.  Some scarring is seen within the lingula.
     
     Within the visualized portions of the upper abdomen, ascites is seen adjacent
     to the liver.  Enlarged lymph nodes are present in the retroperitoneum
     adjacent to the renal vessels, ranging in size up to 1.7 x 1.3 cm.  The
     visualized portions of the liver, spleen, kidneys, and adrenal glands are
     within normal limits.
     
     Bone windows show no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1).  Mediastinal and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.

     within the subcarinal region suggestive of lymphadenopathy measuring 2.2 x 1.1
     cm. Additional enlarged lymph nodes in the precarinal region measure 1.8 x 1.2
     cm. Smaller borderline lymph nodes are present in the prevascular space and
     paratracheal region.  No pathologically enlarged hilar lymph nodes are seen.
     
     No pericardial or pleural effusions are seen.  Scattered areas of peripheral
     ground-glass opacity are seen within both lungs.  These are best seen on
     series 3 images 43 within the right lower lobe, within series 3 image 20
     within the left upper lobe, as well as within series 3 image 49 within the
     peripheral left lower lobe.  No pulmonary nodules or areas of pulmonary
     parenchymal consolidation are seen.  Some scarring is seen within the lingula.
     
     Within the visualized portions of the upper abdomen, ascites is seen adjacent
     to the liver.  Enlarged lymph nodes are present in the retroperitoneum
     adjacent to the renal vessels, ranging in size up to 1.7 x 1.3 cm.  The
     visualized portions of the liver, spleen, kidneys, and adrenal glands are
     within normal limits.
     
     Bone windows show no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1).  Mediastinal and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
     
     2).  No areas of pulmonary parenchymal consolidation or pulmonary nodules.
     Minimal areas of scattered nonspecific ground-glass opacity are seen within

     INDICATION:  HIV.  Fever.  Known mediastinal lymph node enlargement.  Evaluate
     for abdominal nodal enlargement.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT images of the abdomen and pelvis were acquired following
     administration of oral and 150 mL of Optiray IV contrast.
     
     COMPARISON:  Abdominal ultrasound from [**2585-11-27**] and chest CT scan from
     [**2585-11-30**].
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  There are bibasilar areas of atelectasis,
     and diffuse areas of ground glass opacity within both lower lobes, with
     evidence of smooth intralobular septal thickening.  There is a more nodular
     area of tissue attenuation seen in the extreme right posterior CP angle, which
     is new since [**2585-11-30**] and is likely atelectasis.  Again seen is a small
     amount of ascites around the liver.  There is gallbladder wall edema as
     described on the prior abdominal ultrasound, but the gallbladder is not
     distended.  No focal hepatic lesions are identified.  Note is made of an
     enlarged spleen measuring approximately 20 cm in greatest dimension.  There
     are multiple prominent retroperitoneal lymph nodes, the largest of which is a
     left periaortic node adjacent to the left renal vein, which measures 11 mm in
     short axis.  There is mild stranding in the retroperitoneal fat adjacent to
     these lymph nodes, which extends to the root of the mesentery.  The left
     kidney, pancreas, and both adrenal glands are unremarkable.  Note is made of
     multiple small peripheral low attenuation areas in the right kidney, with a
     suggestion of cortical thinning.  These are not significantly changed,
     allowing for differences in bolus timing, compared to the chest CT scan. Small
     bowel loops are normal in caliber.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The distal ureters, bladder, female
     reproductive structures, sigmoid colon, and rectum are unremarkable.  There is
     a small amount of free fluid within the pelvis.  There are no pathologically
     enlarged pelvic lymph nodes.  Note is made of several prominent bilateral
     inguinal nodes, which demonstrate fatty hila and do not meet CT criteria for
     pathological enlargement by size.  The appendix is visualized and is within
     normal limits.
     
     No suspicious osseous lesions are identified.

     INDICATION:  48-year-old woman with HIV and hepatitis-C.  The patient presents
     from an outside hospital with an intracranial hemorrhage.
     
     COMPARISONS:  The CT performed today at an outside hospital is not available
     for comparison.  A CT from [**2585-11-28**] was negative.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast head CT.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is a large intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left hemisphere
     centered in the periventricular white matter.  The hemorrhage extends into the
     bilateral lateral ventricles, including the atrium on the right side and the
     frontal [**Doctor Last Name 67**], and the atrium on the left side.  There is also a small amount
     of blood in the 3rd ventricle.  The ventricles are dilated consistent with
     hydrocephalus.  There is effacement of the sulci consistent with significant
     brain edema.  The [**Doctor Last Name 63**]/white matter differentiation, however, is still
     preserved with the exeption of a portion in the left parietal lobe where there
     is a slight loss of the [**Doctor Last Name 63**]/white matter differentiation.  There is mild
     rightward shift of the midline structures.
     
     IMPRESSION
     1.  Large intracranial hemorrhage in the left hemisphere with involvement of
     the bilateral lateral ventricles and 3rd ventricle.  There is mild shift of
     the rightward shift of the midline structures, and significant diffuse brain
     edema with effacement of all of the sulci. Unfortunately the comparison is not
     avaiable. 
     2.  There is loss of the [**Doctor Last Name 63**]/white matter differentiation a portion of the
     left parietal lobe.
     3. Fluid blood level is noted in the left temporal lobe, of uncertain
     clinical significance. MRI with contrast is recommended for further
     evaluation.

Brief Update 3PM-7PM:
No change in pt's vital signs/mental status. Family came up to me at 4PM and said they would like team and neuro to come and evaluate pt and possible give her another scan to her brain because they have done a lot of praying and they feel she may be improving. They said she opened one of her eyes to her name being called. Team has been notified of this change and will be up to evaluate pt as family have requested. Extubation is on hold for now until she is further evaluated by team.

My neuro assessment has not changed. Pt remains unresponsive. Posturing/stiffness noted to all stimulation. Pupils remain non-reactive and uneven left 3mm, right 2mm. no gag but pt has spontaneous cough noted but not to suctioning. She bites down hard on ETT with suctioning and needs oral airway in place to keep airway open. She remains off labetolol as BP has been under 140 for the most part.

Will update note as needed and follow neuro exam closely for changes.
