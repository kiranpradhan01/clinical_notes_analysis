ventricular  
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).  
  
3.Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are 
normal.  
  
4. A mobile density is seen in the distal ascending aorta 
consistent with an  
intimal flap/aortic dissection. A mobile density is seen in the 
aortic arch  
consistent with an intimal flap/aortic dissection. The aortic 
wall is  
thickened consistent with an intramural hematoma.  
  
5.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is 
severe aortic  
valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Moderate to severe (3+) aortic 
regurgitation is  
seen. T  
  
6.The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Moderate 
(2+) mitral  
regurgitation is seen.  
  
7.There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion. No evidence of 
tamponade.  
  
Post bypass  
  
Pt is being AV paced and receiving an infusion of epinephrine 
and vasopressin.  
  
1. RV systolic function was initially mildly depressed and 
improved  
subsequently with epinephrine.  
  
2. Bioprosthetic valve seen in the aortic position. Leaflets 
appear to move  
well and the valve appears well seated. Trace aortic 
insufficiency.  
  
3. Graft material seen in the ascending aorta.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: tube placement 

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
83 year old woman s/p dissection with repl. asc./hemiarch 
aorta/AVR now s/p trach/peg [**6-22**] 
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
tube placement 
INDICATION: 82-year-old woman with recent tracheostomy. Please 
assess for the tube placement.

The tracheostomy tube is projecting 5.2 cm above the carina and 
is in satisfactory position. The introducer sheath remains in 
the right brachiocephalic vein. Tip of the temporary pacing wire 
is unchanged with its tips noted at the level of the right 
ventricle. NG tube extends into the body of the stomach with 
distal end not included in the film. Mild blunting of both 
costophrenic angles is unchanged compared to the prior study. 
Mild mediastinal widening is also unchanged compared to the 
prior study and is not an uncommon finding after recent CABG.

Small bilateral pleural effusions. There is no pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION:
1. Appropriate position of the tracheostomy tube with its tip 
projecting 5.2 cm above the carina.
2. The remainder of the lines and tubes are in satisfactory 
position.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**6-3**] and went directly from ER to OR with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] 
for surgery. Transferred to the CSRU in stable condition on 
epinephrine, propofol and nitroglycerin drips. Epinephrine tuned 
off shortly after arrival to CSRU, but multiple drips then 
titrated for tight BP management.Chest tubes and Swan removed on 
POD #2. All narcotics stopped for eval.as she appeared to not 
move left arm appropriately. Tube feeds started on POD #3 and 
beta blockade titrated. Very brief period of asystole on [**6-7**] 
that responded immediately to pacing, and then went into Afib. 
Seen by EP service for AV block. She went in and out of Afib and 
was cardioverted over the next 2 days. Procainamide started per 
EP recs. 

Extubated the afternoon of 6/9 but required emergency 
reintubation that evening for respiratory failure. Over the next 
few days her WBC rose to 26K and she wqas pancultured with 
empiric triple abx started. Heparin was started for Afib and the 
next day she decompensated with a drop in Hct. CT scan showed 
cardiac tamponade and she returned to the OR on [**6-14**] for 
re-exploration, but this continued to delay a pacer implantation 
planned by EP. Temporary transvenous pacer placed later that 
day. Lactate, LFTs and creatinine continued to rise with melena. 
General surgery consult done Epinephrine drip continued for 
support, and pitressin restarted on [**6-16**].  Renal consult done 
and CVVHD started on [**6-16**]. Epi weaned on [**6-17**], and Afib 
continued despite amiodarone therapy. Steroid therapy also 
continued to be weaned. Diarrhea and continued elev. WBC 
prompted evaluation for C. diff.

Thoracic surgery initially evaluated pt. for trach and PEG on 
[**6-18**].Social work also continued to meet with the family 
regarding prognosis, need for dialysis, and the patient's 
wishes. Family meeting held with surgeon on [**6-21**] with initial 
plan to allow dialysis as needed,continue care, and hopefully 
transfer to nursing home for further recovery when ready. 
However, on [**6-22**] the family was reconsidering and team notified. 
Trach/PEG/flex. bronch done on [**6-22**] also. She continued to have 
significant melena, was transfused and was again seen by 
transplant surgery. Renal service recommended continuing 
dialysis, but requested tunneled long-term access. 
On [**6-26**], the family decided not to continue long-term dialysis 
and she did not follow commands. Hospice care and comfort 
measures only discussed with the family and the medical ethics 
consult done given the disagreement about possible prognosis. 
Final decision was to transfer care to the MICU attending on 
[**6-26**]. Patient was made CMO, pacer and vent were discontinued per 
family wishes. She expired on [**6-27**].

     INDICATION:  Aortic dissection repair.
     
     CHEST, ONE VIEW:  No prior for comparison.  Endotracheal tube is approximately
     2.5 cm above the carina.  Swan-Ganz catheter terminates in the pulmonary
     outflow tract.  Nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm.  A left chest
     tube is in place.  Two mediastinal tubes are present.  Mediastinal widening
     may be consistent with patient's history of aortic aneurysm repair.  Mild
     pulmonary edema is present, as are bilateral lower lobe atelectasis, left
     greater than right, and probable small left pleural effusion.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Expected postoperative appearance of recent aortic repair.

     HISTORY:  Aortic dissection or partial replacement.
     
     IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**6-3**] at 11:29 p.m.
     
     Postoperative mediastinal widening has improved, lung volumes have increased
     though bibasilar opacification suggests persistent mild edema and/or
     atelectasis.  Pleural effusion, if any, is small.  There my be a tiny left
     apical pneumothorax.  Nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of
     view.  Tip of Swan-Ganz line projects over the main pulmonary artery.  ET tube
     ends above the upper margin of the clavicles, more than 4.5 cm from the
     carina, probably 2 cm above optimal placement.  Heart size is top normal.

     The patient is rotated.
     
     There are sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips. The cardiomediastinal
     silhouette is enlarged. There is left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation
     and possible small left effusion.  There is minimal blunting of the right
     costophrenic angle, consistent with a small right effusion, as well as some
     pleural fluid or thickening along the right lateral chest wall.
     
     An ET tube is present, tip 1.7 cm above the carina.  An NG tube is present,
     tip extending beneath diaphragm overlying fundus.  A right IJ sheath is
     present --allowing for patient rotation this likely overlies the proximal SVC.
     
     Clips are noted in the upper abdomen.  Residual pacing wires are suggested.
     Osteopenia and degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are noted.

Pt on AC vent after being re-intubated yesterday. She is on AC vent @ 20 PBPM. ABG showing some hypocarbia and pH is mildly alkalotic but pt RR exceeds set rate of 20 and pH always remains about the same indicating there is some metabolic component.

     EXAMINATION:  AP chest.
     
     INDICATION:  Status post aortic surgery.
     
     Single AP view of the chest is obtained on [**2655-6-14**] at 11:45 hours and compared
     with the prior study performed approximately eight hours previously.  The
     patient remains intubated with the tip of the ET tube approximately 2.4 cm
     above the carina.  Swan-Ganz line remains in place with its tip directed
     towards the right pulmonary artery.  Bilateral pleural tubes are present.
     There is increased opacification of the left hemithorax compared to the right
     consistent with layering effusion posteriorly.  No pneumothorax is visible.
     Widening of the mediastinum is not significantly changed. There is mild
     pulmonary vascular prominence which is increased since the prior study may
     represent some developing fluid overload.  Nasogastric tube is present with
     its tip not included on the current image.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Left-sided pleural effusion increasing since the prior study.  Left lower lobe
     atelectasis unchanged.  Widened mediastinum consistent with leak following
     recent surgery. Please refer to the recent CT concerning details of recent
     leak into the pericardium.

     Portable AP chest radiograph compared to [**2655-6-14**] obtained at 11:47 a.m.
     
     The ET tube tip is 3 cm above the carina.  The Swan-Ganz tip terminates in the
     right main pulmonary artery.  The second central venous line inserted through
     right subclavian vein is a newly inserted temporary pacemaker and it
     terminates deep in the right atrium   The two left chest tubes and one right
     chest tubes are in unchanged position.  No significant increase in left
     pleural effusion is demonstrated.  Mediastinal drains are noted, unchanged.
     The NG tube tip passes below the diaphragm and most likely terminating in the
     stomach.  There is no sizable change in the cardiomediastinal silhouette.
     There is bilateral perihilar haziness which might represent volume overload or
     congestive heart failure.

     EXAMINATION:  CTA of the chest with and without contrast [**2655-6-14**].
     
     COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray, [**2655-6-14**].
     
     INDICATION:  83-year-old female status post dissection, acute blood loss with
     15-point hematocrit drop in last 24 hours.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial imaging was obtained through the chest before and after the
     administration of IV contrast.  Images were reformatted in the coronal and
     sagittal planes.
     
     FINDINGS FOR CT OF THE CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  The patient is
     status post median sternotomy.  There is stranding of the subcutaneous fat
     anterior to the sternum consistent with a small hematoma.  There is large
     acute high density material within the pericardial space, which measures 4.6
     cm at the level of the right atrium, results in mass effect on the superior
     vena cava, right atrium, and pulmonary artery.  There is acute hematoma
     surrounding the aortic root. The right atrium is distorted by the large
     pericardial hematoma.  There is a 3-mm focus of high density contrast material
     seen on image #33, series 3, which may represent active extravasation,
     however, this is uncertain due to the distortion of the right atrium adjacent.
     The periaortic hematoma and pericardial hematoma high density and indicates
     recent hemorrhage corresponding to patient's history of recent hematocrit
     drop.  The patient is status post aortic root repair.  The graft is seen
     extending from the aortic root to the proximal aortic arch.  There is
     atherosclerotic calcification of the abdominal aorta.  There are bilateral
     pleural effusions, left greater than right, which are free flowing. There is
     adjacent compressive atelectasis. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  An NG
     tube is demonstrated within the esophagus, terminating within the body of the
     stomach. A Swan-Ganz catheter is demonstrated with tip in the right main
     pulmonary artery.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN:  The abdominal aorta is normal in caliber.  The patient is
     status post cholecystectomy.  Evaluation of the intra-abdominal organs is
     limited due to phase of imaging; no delayed images were obtained due to
     patient's unstable vital signs.  There is fat stranding in the perinephric
     region.  The bowel is normal in caliber.  The contours of the liver, spleen,
     pancreas, adrenal glands are unremarkable.  There is stranding of the
     mesenteric fat.  Calcified lymph nodes are demonstrated within the right lower
                                                                 (Over)

     CT PELVIS:  There is sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence of
     diverticulitis.  A Foley balloon catheter is demonstrated inflated within the
     bladder and the bladder is decompressed.  The uterus is present and is
     unremarkable.  There is no ascites or lymphadenopathy.  There is a small right
     fat containing inguinal hernia.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.  Old left-
     sided third and fourth rib fractures are demonstrated laterally.  There is
     mild degenerative disease of thoracic and moderate degenerative disease of the
     lumbar spine.  Old fracture of the left pubis is demonstrated.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Large acute pericardial hematoma and hematoma surrounding the aortic root
     resulting in mass effect on the right atrium, pulmonary artery, and SVC.  The
     hematoma is high density indicating very recent hemorrhage.  There is a 3-mm
     focus of high attenuation located between the pericardial hematoma and
     hematoma surrounding the aortic root as described above, which may represent a
     focus of acute hemorrhage, however evaluation of this region is difficult due
     to distortion of the right atrium by the large pericardial hematoma.
     
     2.  Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right and adjacent
     bibasilar atelectasis.  
     
     3.  Sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.

     EXAMINATION:  CTA of the chest with and without contrast [**2655-6-14**].
     
     COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray, [**2655-6-14**].
     
     INDICATION:  83-year-old female status post dissection, acute blood loss with
     15-point hematocrit drop in last 24 hours.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial imaging was obtained through the chest before and after the
     administration of IV contrast.  Images were reformatted in the coronal and
     sagittal planes.
     
     FINDINGS FOR CT OF THE CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  The patient is
     status post median sternotomy.  There is stranding of the subcutaneous fat
     anterior to the sternum consistent with a small hematoma.  There is large
     acute high density material within the pericardial space, which measures 4.6
     cm at the level of the right atrium, results in mass effect on the superior
     vena cava, right atrium, and pulmonary artery.  There is acute hematoma
     surrounding the aortic root. The right atrium is distorted by the large
     pericardial hematoma.  There is a 3-mm focus of high density contrast material
     seen on image #33, series 3, which may represent active extravasation,
     however, this is uncertain due to the distortion of the right atrium adjacent.
     The periaortic hematoma and pericardial hematoma high density and indicates
     recent hemorrhage corresponding to patient's history of recent hematocrit
     drop.  The patient is status post aortic root repair.  The graft is seen
     extending from the aortic root to the proximal aortic arch.  There is
     atherosclerotic calcification of the abdominal aorta.  There are bilateral
     pleural effusions, left greater than right, which are free flowing. There is
     adjacent compressive atelectasis. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  An NG
     tube is demonstrated within the esophagus, terminating within the body of the
     stomach. A Swan-Ganz catheter is demonstrated with tip in the right main
     pulmonary artery.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN:  The abdominal aorta is normal in caliber.  The patient is
     status post cholecystectomy.  Evaluation of the intra-abdominal organs is
     limited due to phase of imaging; no delayed images were obtained due to
     patient's unstable vital signs.  There is fat stranding in the perinephric
     region.  The bowel is normal in caliber.  The contours of the liver, spleen,
     pancreas, adrenal glands are unremarkable.  There is stranding of the
     mesenteric fat.  Calcified lymph nodes are demonstrated within the right lower

     The ET tube tip is 3 cm above the carina.  The Swan-Ganz tip terminates in the
     right main pulmonary artery.  The second central venous line inserted through
     right subclavian vein is a newly inserted temporary pacemaker and it
     terminates deep in the right atrium   The two left chest tubes and one right
     chest tubes are in unchanged position.  No significant increase in left
     pleural effusion is demonstrated.  Mediastinal drains are noted, unchanged.
     The NG tube tip passes below the diaphragm and most likely terminating in the
     stomach.  There is no sizable change in the cardiomediastinal silhouette.
     There is bilateral perihilar haziness which might represent volume overload or

     INDICATION:  Status post aortic surgery.
     
     Single AP view of the chest is obtained on [**2655-6-14**] at 11:45 hours and compared
     with the prior study performed approximately eight hours previously.  The
     patient remains intubated with the tip of the ET tube approximately 2.4 cm
     above the carina.  Swan-Ganz line remains in place with its tip directed
     towards the right pulmonary artery.  Bilateral pleural tubes are present.
     There is increased opacification of the left hemithorax compared to the right
     consistent with layering effusion posteriorly.  No pneumothorax is visible.
     Widening of the mediastinum is not significantly changed. There is mild
     pulmonary vascular prominence which is increased since the prior study may
     represent some developing fluid overload.  Nasogastric tube is present with
     its tip not included on the current image.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Left-sided pleural effusion increasing since the prior study.  Left lower lobe
     atelectasis unchanged.  Widened mediastinum consistent with leak following
     recent surgery. Please refer to the recent CT concerning details of recent
     leak into the pericardium.

     HISTORY:  Status post dissection repair.
     
     One portable view.  Comparison with [**2655-6-14**].  There appears to be some
     interval improvement in pulmonary vascular congestion and widening of the
     mediastinum consistent with post-surgical change.  Increased density in the
     upper left chest is consistent with the presence of loculated fluid and
     possibly underlying consolidation or atelectasis.  There is interval
     improvement in retrocardiac density consistent with volume loss in the left
     lower lobe.  An endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, Swan-Ganz catheter, right
     subclavian catheter, mediastinal drains, two left chest tubes and one right
     chest tube remain in place.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Interval improvement in pulmonary vascular congestion and
     atelectasis or consolidation in the left lower lobe.
