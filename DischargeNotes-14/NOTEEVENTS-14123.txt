Admission Date:  [**2899-9-28**]       Discharge Date:  [**2899-10-26**]

Date of Birth:   [**2829-9-10**]       Sex:  M

Service:  BLUMEGART

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 71-year-old
male with a history of type 2 diabetes, coronary artery
disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting on
[**2889-11-22**], status post aortic valve replacement in
[**2886**], severe peripheral vascular disease, who presented to
the hospital on [**2899-9-28**], for elective femoral to
popliteal bypass in the setting of a chronic nonhealing left
plantar surface foot ulcer.

The patient had the femoral to popliteal bypass on [**2899-10-1**], without complication.  This was followed by a left
transmetatarsal amputation on [**10-7**] for persistent
nonhealing ulcer.

The [**Hospital 101**] hospital course was complicated by persistent
hypoxia postprocedure requiring high levels of oxygen until
discharge.

The patient was followed by the Surgical Service with
Cardiology and Pulmonary consult until [**2899-10-15**], when
he was transferred for continued medical management of
persistent hypoxia.

The patient had a baseline function prior to admission,
walking [**1-19**] miles a day with mild shortness of breath, and
this was a drastic change from his baseline.

Prior to transfer to the Medical Service, the patient was
treated with aggressive diuresis for suspected congestive
heart failure, nebulizers for emphysema, and initial
broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected infected foot ulcer.

The patient does have a heavy smoking history in the past,
approximately 50 to 100 packs/year history and worked as a
welder for approximately 40 years with large asbestos
exposure as well.  The patient reported having stopped
smoking approximately 10-15 years ago.

ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN WITH UNKNOWN REACTION.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Type 2 diabetes, coronary artery
disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting in
[**2889-11-22**], status post aortic valve replacement with
St. Jude valve in [**2886**], severe peripheral vascular disease.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Glucovance 5/500 p.o. b.i.d.,
Pravachol 20 mg p.o. q.d., Platol 100 mg b.i.d., Warfarin 2
mg q.d.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 96.6��, blood
pressure ..................., pulse 104, respirations 20.
General:  The patient was a mildly obese male in no apparent
distress.  HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Moist mucous
membranes.  Chest:  There was a median sternotomy incision.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular:
Regular, rate and rhythm.  Normal S1.  Metallic S2.  No
carotid bruits.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.  No
palpable masses.  Extremities:  Left leg had a well-healed
vein harvest site.  There was a 2 x 3 cm ulcerated mass
behind the left great toe.  This did not probe to bone.
Right leg with amputated first digit.  Vascular:  The patient
had 2+ carotids, 2+ radials, nonpalpable dorsalis pedis
bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission white blood cell count was
15.4, hematocrit 38.3; PT 16.9, PTT 28.6, INR 1.9; CHEM7 133,
4.7, 93, 27, 14, 0.8, 187.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This was a 71-year-old male with a past
medical history significant for type 2 diabetes, severe
peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, aortic
valve replacement, originally admitted for an elective
femoral to popliteal bypass in the setting of a left
nonhealing plantar surface foot ulcer for approximately six
months, whose course was complicated by persistent hypoxia
and shortness of breath following the original surgery on
[**2899-10-1**], and a left foot transmetatarsal amputation
on [**2899-10-7**].

1.  Hypoxia:  The patient had persistent hypoxia postsurgery
requiring high levels of oxygen with nasal oxygen on a 50%
shovel mask for approximately two weeks postprocedure.

The patient was originally treated for what was thought to be
a congestive heart failure exacerbation.  An echocardiogram
was performed on [**10-16**] which showed a depressed ejection
fraction and a poor study.  Ejection fraction on [**10-1**]
showed an ejection fraction of approximately 48%, normal left
ventricle, with an inferior wall defect.

Consequently the patient was treated with aggressive diuresis
and demonstrated only moderate improvement in his shortness
of breath.  The patient also had a long history of smoking
and asbestos exposure.  CT exam performed on [**9-29**]
showed isolated pleural plaques with right apical thickening,
central lobar emphysematous change, and multiple ground-glass
opacities suggestive congestive heart failure versus an
infectious process.

On [**2899-10-15**], the patient was transferred to the
Medical Team to further evaluate this hypoxia.  At that
particular time, he was reported to have some moderate
improvement over the [**2-17**] proceeding days; however, over the
weekend of [**10-17**], he became markedly hypoxic and
suffered a probable PA arrest and was intubated and
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.

The patient was extubated without complications.  He was
treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.  He was diuresed in
the setting of mild congestive heart failure and treated with
nebulizers for a new diagnosis of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease.

The patient was transferred back to the floor, continuing his
medical management for his hypoxia.  On discharge, his oxygen
requirement had decreased to 1 L, and he was breathing
comfortably on room air with an oxygen saturation of
approximately 96%.

2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease:  The patient had a
new diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on
this admission in the setting of long-term smoking history
and asbestos exposure.  He was treated with Albuterol and
Atrovent nebs, albuterol p.r.n., titrating the oxygen
saturation to greater than 92%.  He was given aggressive
chest physical therapy as well.

The patient will be discharged on metered dose inhalers to be
continued as an outpatient with follow-up with his primary
care physician.

3.  Congestive heart failure:  The patient has evidence of
congestive heart failure during this admission with a
markedly depressed ejection fraction from
[**10-15**].  He was treated with fluid restrictions with
strict I/Os, Lasix 40 mg b.i.d., Lopressor and Lisinopril.
He will continue with these medications as an outpatient.

4.  Pneumonia/sepsis:  When the patient was transferred into
the Intensive Care Unit, there was a question of whether it
was an infected process.  Blood cultures were repeatedly
negative.  Bronchial lavage and washings were also negative.
TTE showed no evidence of endocarditis; however, given the
patient's persistent hypoxia, he was continued on a 7-day
course of Ceftazidime.  The patient will not be discharged on
antibiotics following discharge.

5.  Left femoral to popliteal bypass/left transmetatarsal
amputation:  Please seen surgical notes for complete details
and surgical dictation on procedure.

During the patient's stay on the Medical Service, he was
treated with b.i.d. dressing changes, wet-to-dry.  There was
no evidence of infection.  The patient was not continued on
any antibiotics.  The patient will be followed by the
Vascular Team as an outpatient.

6.  Transaminitis:  The patient had mildly elevated AST and
LSD following admission to the Intensive Care Unit.  There
was some question as to whether this was related to ""shock
liver"" in the setting of hypertension following his PA
arrest. Levels remained mildly elevated on discharge with an
AST of 50 and ALT of 90.  This could also be due to his
Pravastatin use.  This should be followed as an outpatient.

7.  Coronary artery disease/peripheral vascular
disease/aortic valve replacement:  The patient was continued
on ACE inhibitor, statin and was anticoagulated with Heparin,
and was subtherapeutic on Coumadin following his surgical
procedure.  The patient was discharged with an INR of 1.9 on
Heparin to his nursing care facility on a dose of 5 mg p.o.
q.d.

He will need aggressive follow-up to ensure therapeutic INR
within 2.0-3.0 range.  His prior home dose was 2 mg p.o.
q.d.; however, following administration of antibiotics, he
has required additional levels of Coumadin.  Please follow
b.i.d. until assurance of appropriate levels.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
Pravastatin 20 mg p.o. q.d., Ipratropium Bromide 18
mcg/aerosol 2 puffs q.i.d., Albuterol ..................

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  71 y/o man with an ischemic left foot.
     
     There are no prior studies for comparison.
     
     PA AND LATERAL CHEST:  The heart size is at the upper limits of normal. No
     definite hilar or mediastinal mass is seen.
     
     The right lung appears markedly abnormal. There are extensive pleural based
     changes, including a large area of homogeneous increased density in the right
     lung apex. There is also increased pleural based density laterally and in the
     region of the right costophrenic angle. Additionally there is pleural
     thickening posteriorly on the lateral film.
     
     There are scattered foci of streaky increased denstiy in the lung parenchyma
     bilaterally. There may be a small focus of calcification in the right
     hemidiaphragm.
     
     There is a smaller amount of pleural thickening in the left lung apex. There
     is no evidence of CHF or overt air space infiltrate.
     
     The patient has had a prior median sternotomy and CABG.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Extensive pleural based abnormality, primarily in the right
     hemithorax, as described, of unknown etiology.  A superior sulcus tumor or
     pleural malignancy cannot be excluded.
     
     Recommend correlation with clinical history and prior radiographs. If not
     known findings, a CT scan can be performed.
     
     These findings were relayed to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 6556**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1085**] at the time of the exam.

     INDICATION:  Further characterization of right apical pleural thickening
     demonstrated on recent chest radiograph.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helical chest CT using 100 cc of IV Optiray contrast (allergy),
     and 5 mm collimation.  1.25 mm slice thickness image were retrospectively
     reconstructed.
     
     COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs, [**2899-9-28**].
     
     CHEST CT WITH IV CONTRAST:  The soft tissue window images demonstrate slight
     increase of pleural fat at the right apex.  There is a loculated small right
     effusion with a thickened rind, at the posterior right lung base.  There are
     calcified right pleural plaques and also right apical pleural thickening,
     which contains calcifications.  There is no significant mediastinal, hilar, or
     axillary lymphadenopathy.  The heart size is normal.  There are coronary
     artery calcifications and the patient is status post CABG.  There is a small
     axial hiatal hernia.
     
     The lung window images demonstrate centrilobular emphysematous changes,
     particularly at the lung apices, with biapical bullae.  There is right upper
     lobe volume loss with scarring and traction bronchiectasis.  There is also
     scarring adjacent to the right effusion.  There are peribronchovascular
     ground-glass opacities within the left upper lobe and lingula.  They are also
     faintly seen on the scout AP images, but not on the pre-op chest radiographs
     of [**2899-9-28**].  The airways are patent to the level of the segmental
     bronchi bilaterally.
     
     In the imaged portions of the upper abdomen, teh visualized portions of the
     liver, kidneys, adrenal glands, spleen, and pancreas appear normal. The
     patient is status post cholecystectomy.  There are calcifications of the right
     renal artery.
     
     The skeletal structures of the thorax demonstrate no significant abnormality.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1.  Calcified right fibrothorax with right apical scarring, a
     small loculated right effusion, and increased right apical pleural fat.  The
     presence of increased extrapleural fat and pleural calcification are
     suggestive of benign post inflammatory changes, and this constellation of
     findings is probably due to prior granulomatous infection.  However, active
     disease in the pleural space cannot be excluded and sampling of pleural fluid
                                                                 (Over)

     [**2899-9-28**], this may represent asymmetric pulmonary edema, an early
     infectious process, or aspiration.  Continued follow up is recommended to
     ensure resolution.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Peripheral vascular disease with non-healing wound on left foot.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 1584**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 23**] performed the procedure, with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 23**],
     Attending Physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1827**] and supervising the entire procedure.
     
     The patient's left groin was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.
     Left femoral pulse was not palpable.  A calcified left femoral artery was
     visualized under fluoroscopic guidance, and the artery was accessed under
     fluoroscopic guidance. Under fluoroscopic guidance, a wire was advanced into
     the aorta, and a 4- French sheath was placed.  An infrarenal aortogram was
     obtained which demonstrated apparent focal dilatation of the infrarenal aorta
     to 2.2 cm.  The remainder of the aorta was approximately 1.5 cm in caliber. If
     there is concern for aneurysm, this could be followed by ultrasound.  There is
     mild, diffuse atherosclerotic change within both common and external iliac
     arteries. No appreciable pressure gradient was detected within the aortoiliac
     system.
     
     The catheter was withdrawn into the left external iliac artery. Angiograms
     were obtained.  Left leg runoff demonstrated a small, diffusely diseased
     superficial femoral artery. There is a focal atherosclerotic plaque within the
     distalmost aspect of the popliteal artery just prior to the take- off of the
     anterior tibial artery. The anterior tibial artery is occluded within the
     distal third of the calf. The posterior tibial artery is occluded at its
     origin, but reconstitutes within the distal third of the lower leg to supply
     the foot. Innumerable collateral vessels are noted within the calf and lower
     leg. Surgical clips are present from a prior vein harvest.  A very small
     dorsalis pedis partially reconstitutes on delayed imaging.
     
     ANESTHESIA:  2 cc of 1% lidocaine for local analgesia.  Conscious sedation
     with 1 mg of Versed and 100 mcg of fentanyl in incremental doses under
     continuous cardiac monitoring.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None apparent.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) Focal apparent dilatation of the infrarenal aorta.  If there is concern for
     aneurysm, this could be followed by ultrasound.

     INDICATION:  71 y/o male with peripheral vascular disease.  Significant distal
     runoff disease with extensive calcification involving the vessels.
     
     Segmental pressures, PVRs, and ankle brachial indices were attempted.
     
     On the right, there are triphasic waveforms demonstrated in the femoral,
     popliteal, tibial and dorsalis pedis vessels.  ABIs were inaccurate due to
     extensive calcification.
     
     On the left, the femoral and popliteal vessels demonstrate triphasic
     waveforms.  At the tibial vessels, the waveform becomes monophasic distally.
     Ankle brachial indices again are inaccurate due to extensive calcification.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Limited study due to extensive calcification in noncompressible
     vessels.  Findings suggestive of significant left tibial arterial disease, as
     demonstrated by monophasic waveforms below the left knee.

     HISTORY:  Seventy-one year old man with diabetes and claudication.
     
     SUMMARY OF EXERCISE DATA FROM THE REPORT OF THE EXERCISE LAB:
     Dipyridamole was infused intravenously for 4 minutes at a dose of 0.142  
     mg/kg/min. Two minutes after the cessation of infusion, Tc-99m sestamibi was
     administered IV.
     
     INTERPRETATION: 
     
     Image Protocol: Gated SPECT.
     
     Resting perfusion images were obtained with thallium-201.
     Tracer was injected 15 minutes prior to obtaining the resting images.
     
     Stress images show a normal LV cavity size.  There is a mild decrease in tracer
     uptake within the inferior left ventricular wall.
     
     Resting perfusion images show an unchanged pattern of myocardial tracer uptake.
       
     Ejection fraction calculated from gated wall motion images obtained after
     Dipyridamole administration is 48%.  There is mild inferior wall hypokinesis.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Mild inferior left ventricular wall fixed perfusion defect.  Mild
     inferior wall hypokinesis, EF of 48%.

     FINDINGS: Median sternotomy wires and CABG clips are noted. Again seen is
     extensive pleural abnormality within the right apical region likely
     representing pleural thickening. A loculated small right pleural effusion is
     also noted. There is right apical scarring present with associated right lung
     volume loss. These findings are unchanged compared to prior exam. There has
     been interval placement of a right internal jugular central venous line with
     tip in the mid superior vena cava, without evidence of pneumothorax. The left
     lung remains grossly clear. The cardiac and mediastinal contours remain
     unchanged.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1) Satisfactory placement of right internal jugular central venous
     line. 2) Unchanged appearance of extensive right pleural abnormalities, right
     apical scarring, and right lung volume loss. 3) Left lung remains grossly
     clear.

     FINDINGS:  Standard PA and left lateral upright views.  Comparison study dated
     [**2899-10-13**].  There is again evidence of extensive patchy ill-defined
     pulmonary infiltrates in both upper lobes, slightly increased since the
     previous day.  This is consistent with worsening pulmonary edema.  The prior
     extensive pleural thickening overlying the right lung and the pleural effusion
     at the left base, also extending over the left upper lobe, remain unchanged.
     Bullae overlie the left infrahilar region, as before.  Chronic interstitial
     changes are again noted at both bases.  The heart again shows moderate
     enlargement with evidence of the old CABG procedure.  The right IJ central
     line remains in good position with its tip in mid SVC.
     
     IMPRESSION:  The pulmonary edema appears slightly worsened since the previous
     day.  The chronic pulmonary and pleural changes bilaterally remain unaltered.

     INDICATION: Status post thoracocentesis, evaluate for pneumothorax.
     
     AP single view of the chest again demonstrates status post sternotomy and
     bypass surgery. The patient remains intubated the tip of the ETT located some
     5 cm above the carina. The left subclavian approach central venous line is
     also unchanged in position. An NG tube is present reaching far below the
     diaphragm.
     
     The right lung is compromised by the presence of pulmonary densities most
     marked in the apical area. The left lung remains well expanded. However the
     single view film does not cover entirely the left lateral pleural sinus.
     Comparison with the next previous examination suggests some clearance of the
     previously present pulmonary infiltrates with most remarkable clearance of the
     left lung. Pleural densities however remain unchanged. There is no conclusive
     evidence of pneumothorax.

     AP UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST:  Left and right subclavian lines are unchanged in
     position. There is no pneumothorax.  Endotracheal tube and NG tubes remain in
     good position.  Sternal wires and mediastinal clips are noted.  The left lung
     is grossly clear, though there is some pleural thickening or fluid at the CP
     angle on the left and some apical pleural thickening on that side as well.
     There is dense opacity at the right lung apex which may be a combination of a
     pleural and parenchymal process.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are
     unchanged.  There appears to be pleural calcification along the right
     hemidiaphragm.  Overall the appearance is unchanged from the study earlier
     today and yesterday's examination.  There is calcification noted in the
     vicinity of the carotid arteries bilaterally in the neck.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No pneumothorax.  Stable radiographic appearance of the chest
     with right apical opacity being the most pronounced finding.

   overall, the pt appears to be doing well s/p extubation yesterday.  although frequently expectorating moderate amts of thick, tan sputum. he is transiently desaturating into the high '[**75**]'s. cpt and incentive spirometry q4hrs did help to improve saturations. also of note, the pt was restarted on low dose lopressor. a significant difference was noted between arterial and cuff pressures; since the arterial line was dampened, it was removed following a discussion w/the housestaff.

review of systems

respiratory-> lung exam w/course bs and occational expiratory wheezing. pt is generally maintaining sats >92-93% on 4l o2 via cannula. 

cardiac-> hr 60-70's, sr w/rare pvc's. sbp 120-150's via nbp. pt c/o pleurtic chest 'soreness' and an ekg was obtained at the team's request. 

neuro-> pt is alert and oriented. he is cooperating w/his care as he is able. 

gi-> abd is soft, nontender w/+bs. fic bag intact, draining liquid, brown stool. advance diet as pt is able today.

gu-> uop is quite good as the pt is maintaining a negative tfb. 

access-> right tl ij is patent and intact.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:

      smoking and asbestos exposures as a welder. 
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      chf vs infection

                                     FINAL REPORT
     TWO VIEW CHEST OF [**2899-10-23**].
     
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Smoking.  Asbestos exposure.
     
     Comparison is made to prior study of [**2899-10-20**].
     
     A right subclavian catheter remains in place in satisfactory position.  There
     has been interval extubation of the patient and removal of a nasogastric tube.
      Cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to compare due to rotation of
     the patient but are essentially stable.  There is bilateral hazy increased
     opacification of the lungs which has increased in the interval, and there is a
     more confluent area of opacification developing within the region of the right
     upper lobe.  There is asymmetrical apical thickening on the right compared to
     the left which extends below the level of the right third posterior rib level.
      Small pleural effusions are seen bilaterally with some extension of fluid
     into the major fissure on the right.
     
     There is a suggestion of underlying bullous emphysema in the retrosternal
     region on the lateral radiograph.
     
     When comparison is made to an older chest x-ray of [**2899-10-14**], there was
     a similar asymmetrical distribution of opacification of the lungs which was
     more severe at that time.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Based on review of serial chest radiographs, the overall findings
     favor an asymmetrical distribution of congestive heart failure, although it is
     difficult to exclude a superimposed infection in the right upper lobe.
     Follow-up radiographs after diuresis may be helpful in this regard.
     
     Marked apical thickening on the right which is stable compared to [**2899-9-28**].  There is also associated volume loss on the right.  These findings may
     be related to the previously-described fibrothorax, but there is likely also a
     component of pleural effusion.
