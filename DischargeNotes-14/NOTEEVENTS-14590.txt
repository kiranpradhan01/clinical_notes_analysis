Admission Date:  [**2770-6-9**]     Discharge Date:  [**2770-8-20**]

Date of Birth:   [**2687-12-5**]     Sex:  M

Service:  Medicine

Addendum:

The patient went to surgery on [**8-6**], having an
ileocolectomy secondary to a colonic mass.  There were no
intraoperative complications.  The patient went to the floor
and started developing increased oxygen requirement, as well
as elevated white count.  He was hypoxemic.  He was admitted,
over the course of a few days worsened, entered an acute
hypoxemic respiratory failure state thought to be secondary
to aspiration pneumonitis.  As it worsened, he was put on
antibiotics and admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
There, he was intubated, diuresed aggressively.  There were
bilateral pleural effusions on chest x-ray.  This was
complicated by pneumothorax.  A chest tube was placed.  Once
the pneumothorax resolved, the chest tube was pulled on the
26th.

The patient, at this time, was having increasing white cell
count and on [**8-17**], had a new infiltrate on chest x-ray
and this was believed to be a persistent aspiration
pneumonia.  At this point, the family decided to not add
anymore care, to not further work up.  When the patient was
on the floor on the 27th, the family decided to remove
[**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 10909**] [**Last Name (un) 644**] medication, antibiotics, lines and to stop
any work up for the pneumonia as well as anything invasive.
Therefore, on the 28th, the respiratory rate dropped to 6 per
minute.

There will be an addendum to possibly change the discharge
date.

     INDICATION:  Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 247**] with weakness and shortness of breath.  History
     of CHF.
     
     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST:  There is a small left effusion.  There is
     elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with right basilar atelectasis. A more
     focal ovoid opacity just above the right hemidiaphragm laterally may represent
     focal fluid inthe fissure, however a nodule is not excluded and attention to
     this area on follow exams is recommended. There is left lower lobe
     consolidation and collapse. Heart size cannot be assessed. The superior
     mediastinal contour is prominent but likely related to low lung volumes and AP
     technique.  There is minimal if any upper zone redistribution.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis/consolidation and
     small left sided effusion.

     INDICATION:  ? pulmonary embolism in patient with h/o weakness and sob in the
     setting of myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 247**].
     
     TECHNIQUE: Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     thoracic inlet to lung bases after the administration of 100 cc of Optiray,
     used secondary to pulmonary CTA fast bolus protocol.  Multiplanar reformations
     were subsequently obtained and reviewed.
     
     No prior studies available for comparison:
     
     CT CHEST W/CONTRAST (PULMONARY CTA):  There is adequate opacification of the
     pulmonary arterial vessels and there are no filling defects or paucity of
     distal vessels to suggest the presence of pulmonary embolism.  A few scattered
     calcifications are noted in the thoracic aorta.  The heart is normal in size.
     A trace pericardial effusion is noted.  A few small lymph nodes are noted in
     the prevascular, aorto-pulmonary, pretracheal and subcarinal regions of the
     mediastinum, none reaching CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.  There is a
     densely heterogeneously calcified region of the mediastinum inferior and
     medial to the branch point of the right main stem pulmonary bronchus.
     
     The lungs are notable for right lower lobe collapse and associated
     hyperexpansion of the right upper and right middle lobes.  There is associated
     right hemidiaphragm elevation.  There is a moderate amount of atelectasis in
     the left lower lobe dependently and a small left pleural effusion.  No nodules
     or focal consolidations are present.
     
     There is incomplete visualization of the organs of the upper abdomen.  Limited
     views of the liver, spleen, and pancreas are unremarkable.  Patient is s/p
     cholecystectomy.  Small bowel loops are noted to be opacified, likely
     secondary to residual barium from video swallow study.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
     
     2)  Right lower lobe is partially collapsed with associated hyperexpansion of
     the right upper and right middle lobes and elevation of the right
     hemidiaphragm.  There is also mild atelectasis in the left lower lobe with
     associated small left pleural effusion.
     
     3)  Densely  calcified lymph nodes posterior and inferior to the right main
     stem bronchus, likely post-infectious in nature.

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  82-year-old male with thick yellow secretions.  Evaluate for
     infiltrate.
     
     AP/LATERAL VIEWS OF CHEST:  Comparison is made to a previous exam of [**2770-6-19**].
     There has been interval removal of an endotracheal tube.  A right-sided
     central venous catheter remains in satisfactory position.  The cardiac
     silhouette and mediastinal/hilar contours, allowing for differences in
     technique, are not significantly changed.  There are bilateral pleural
     effusions, right side greater than left.  There is associated atelectasis of
     the right lower lobe.  There is also a persistent left lower lobe
     collapse/consolidation which obscures the entire left hemidiaphragm.  There
     are no additional focal consolidations.  There is no evidence of
     pneumothoraces.  The soft tissues and osseous structures are stable.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Bilateral pleural effusions, right side greater than left, with associated
     right lower lobe atelectasis and elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.
     
     2)  Persistent consolidation versus collapse of the left lower lobe.  An
     infectious etiology in this region cannot be excluded and correlation with the
     patient's clinical exam is recommended.
     
     3)  S/P removal of endotracheal and nasogastric tubes.

     Comparison is made to [**2770-6-26**] at 1545.
     
     PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The left-sided PICC is seen to terminate in the
     SVC.  A right-sided IJ central venous catheter also terminates in the SVC. The
     patient is rotated to the right.  There is still collapse within the left
     lower lobe and likely residual collapse/consolidation of the right lower lobe.
     There are bilateral layering pleural effusions.  The pulmonary vasculature is
     within normal limits.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Post left PICC placement.

     AP PORTABLE CHEST:  Comparison is made to previous films from  [**2770-6-26**].
     
     FINDINGS:  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  Calcified
     lymph nodes are seen adjacent to the right hilum, indicative of prior
     granulomous infection. Again noted are bilateral pleural effusions, right
     greater than left. There is an associated haziness adjacent to these effusions
     which likely represents overlay of fluid. There are no focal areas of
     opacification seen to suggest pneumonia. However, the presence of the
     effusions limits our ability to adequately assess the lower lobes.  A PA and
     lateral chest radiograph is recommended to better evaluate the patient when
     clinically stable.  
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Stable bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
     2.  No evidence of pneumonia in this limited study.

     Helically acquired contiguous axial images of the abdomen and pelvis with oral
     and intravenous contrast.
     
     CONTRAST:  Oral contrast and 150 cc Optiray IV due to patient debility.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     ABDOMINAL CT WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:  There are moderate bilateral
     pleural effusions, left greater than right.  There is passive bibasilar
     atelectasis.  There is ascites.  No focal liver lesions are identified.
     Specifically, there is no evidence of metastatic disease.  The patient is

     Chest AP portable single view.
     
     INDICATION:  Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 247**], difficulties to swallow, evaluate for
     pulmonary abnormalities.
     
     FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest demonstrates cardiac enlargement of
     similar magnitude as on the next-preceding examination of 8/14.  The position
     of a permanent pacer with dual electrode system is unchanged and appropriate.
     
     Bilateral basal densities are consistent with pleural effusions, clearly noted
     on the right base.  Observe that the left base is not completely included in
     the image field.  There is no evidence of new parenchymal infiltrates which
     however cannot be complete excluded on the bases because of the pleural
     effusions.  No pneumothorax present.  A right internal jugular vein approach
     central venous line is noted and seen to terminate overlying the SVC
     approximately 3 cm above the carina.  Thus, the position is unchanged.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change.

     COMPARISON: [**2770-8-13**] approximately 21/2 hours prior to the present study.
     
     AP CHEST (TWO VIEWS): Stable appearance of endotracheal tube, dual chamber
     pacemaker wires, and right IJ central line. A new coiled wire is noted
     overlying the left upper lung. The cardiac silhouette and mediastinal and
     hilar contours are unchanged. Stable appearance of blunting of the right
     costophrenic angle and increased opacification of the right lung relative to
     the left consistent with layering effusion. Linear atelectasis is noted at the
     right base. Patchy air space opacifications are also noted in the right mid
     and lower lung and less notably in the left mid and lower lung. There is no
     left effusion.

     AP PORTABLE CHEST:
     
     INDICATION:  S/P aspiration event.  S/P pleural tap right lung, ? right ptx.
     
     The study is compared with prior exam of same day at 1034 hours.
     
     FINDINGS;  An ET tube is seen 6 cm above the carina.  A right IJ central
     venous line is seen with its tip in the SVC.  A cardiac pacemaker is again
     seen with leads in the right atrium and right ventricle.  A right chest tube
     is now seen in the upper right hemithorax.  There is no evidence of
     pneumothorax. There is marked improvement of diffuse haziness on the right
     side, likely secondary to improvement of a right layering pleural effusion,
     s/p patient's right pleural tap.  Bilateral perivascular haze remains.  What
     is seen of the left lung field demonstrates continued patchy alveolar
     opacities.  The left lower lung field and left CP sulcus is not included on
     the exam.  The cardiomediastinal borders are unchanged.
     
     IMPRESSION: Improvement in right-sided pleural effusions, s/p tap. Continued
     evidence of pulmonary edema, left greater than right.  No evidence of
     pneumothorax.

     INDICATION:  Aspiration event.
     
     An endotracheal tube, central venous catheter, and permanent pacemaker remain
     in place.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable in the interval.
     There is persistent vascular engorgement and perihilar haziness.  There is a
     bilateral alveolar pattern which has progressed in the interval in the left
     lung.  Bilateral pleural effusions are noted.  Please note that the right
     lower lung has been incompletely imaged on this study.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Worsening bilateral alveolar pattern.  Although possibly due to
     pulmonary edema, a superimposed aspiration event is possible given the
     provided clinical history.
     
     Bilateral pleural effusions.

     INDICATION: Status post aspiration event. Check for pneumonia or CHF.
     
     FINDINGS: A single AP semi-upright chest image is provided. Comparison study
     dated one day earlier. There is again evidence of extensive patchy ill-defined
     pulmonary infiltrates in both lungs, most severe in the left mid and lower
     zones. These findings are consistent with aspiration pneumonitis. The
     appearances have not changed significantly since the previous study. Note is
     made of fairly marked cardiac enlargement, predominantly left ventricular.
     Dual pacemaker electrodes are noted, satisfactorily positioned in the right
     atrium and right ventricle. A right IJ central line is also noted with its tip
     in the mid SVC. The pulmonary vessels are obscured by the infiltrates. It is
     not possible to exclude some upper zone redistribution which could indicate
     left heart failure.
     
     IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with aspiration pneumonitis, probably
     complicated by left heart failure.
