     ULTRASOUND GUIDED NEEDLE BIOPSY OF THE TRANSPLANT KIDNEY.
     
     INDICATION:  67 year-old male patient, status post renal transplant with
     rising creatinine.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Real time evaluation of the transplant kidney was performed in
     multiple planes using [**Doctor Last Name 63**] scale and color Doppler modalities.  Representative
     images were acquired and evaluated.
     
     FINDINGS AND PROCEDURE:  Evaluation of the transplant kidney, which was
     localized at the right lower quadrant, was performed.  The transplant kidney
     measured 10.8 cm in longitudinal diameter.  Using color Doppler, as well as,
     spectral wave forms, the resistive index was measured at different portions of
     the transplant kidney.  All measurements were elevated and ranging between
     0.85 and 0.95.  These findings are consistent with graft rejection.
     
     A peritransplant collection was seen.  After obtaining written, informed
     consent, and using usual sterile technique, an 18 gauge [**Last Name (un) 1867**] needle was
     inserted into the peritransplant collection.  Approximately 10 cc of serous
     tannish colored fluid were drained.  The fluid was sent to pathology for
     evaluation.
     
     Incidental note of a big anechoic collection localized along the surgical scar
     was observed.  These findings are consistent with a big seroma.
     
     At the end of the procedure, a biopsy site was identified and marked.  The
     nephrology team performed an ultrasound guided biopsy of the transplant kidney
     using an 18 gauge core needle.
     
     There were no complications during the procedure or immediately after the
     procedure.
     
     Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2742**], the staff radiologist, was present during the entire procedure and
     directly supervised it.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful sampling of fluid from a peritransplant collection and
     core biopsy of the transplant kidney as described above.
     
     There are imaging findings consistent with graft rejection.  Incidental note
     of a large seroma along the surgical scar was also made.

     COMPARISON [**2575-9-22**].
     
     RENAL TRANSPLANT ULTRASOUND:  There is an area of high velocity turbulent
     color flow identified in the upper pole of the transplant kidney near the site
     of recent biopsy.  This demonstrates marked spectral broadening and very high
     velocities on doppler interrogation.  The main renal vein demonstrates phasic
     pulsatility.  Resistive indices obtained in the upper pole, mid-pole and lower
     pole are all 0.85.  There is no hydronephrosis.  There is a small collection
     of fluid medial to the lower pole which does not exert mass effect on the
     kidney and which measures 3 x 1 cm.  There is a stable complex appearing fluid

      embolization of av shunt
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     Mr. [**Known patient lastname 12292**] is a 66 y/o man with chronic renal failure who has had coronary
     artery bypass surgery and has been in cardiac failure on one occasion. He is
     admitted because of an AV shunt that resulted from a biopsy of the
     transplanted kidney in the right iliac fossa to have an intervention of
     embolization  of the  AV fistula in upper pole of transplanted kidney.
     Informed consent was obtained.   The right groin was prepped and draped in
     usual sterile manner.  A needle was used to puncture the right femoral artery.
     A guide wire and catheter were passed into the right iliac artery into the
     aorta. The guide wire was exchanged for a flush catheter which demonstrated
     the origin of the transplanted artery in the right external iliac artery just
     below the hypoastric.  We were unable to be advanced into the artery.  This
     was exchanged for a SOS Omni  catheter which easily entered the transplanted
     artery. The SOS catheter was changed for a standard Cobra. Because of the
     fistula in the periphery of the renal cortex a tracker catheter was used to
     pass through the segmental arterial branches into the region of the renal
     cortex. An injection of the contrast material localized the AV shunt. The
     shunt was occluded with 500-700 micron sized particles followed by the
     placement of 3, 2 mm coils into the periphery of the upper pole artery.
     Injection following the occlusion demonstrated no flow distally into the
     cortex with no filling of the previously decribed shunt.
     
     CONCLUSION:  Status post embolization of upper pole renal AV shunt. Note
     approximately 80 ml of contrast material were used.

      embolization of av shunt
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     Mr. [**Known patient lastname 12292**] is a 66 y/o man with chronic renal failure who has had coronary
     artery bypass surgery and has been in cardiac failure on one occasion. He is
     admitted because of an AV shunt that resulted from a biopsy of the
     transplanted kidney in the right iliac fossa to have an intervention of
     embolization  of the  AV fistula in upper pole of transplanted kidney.
     Informed consent was obtained.   The right groin was prepped and draped in
     usual sterile manner.  A needle was used to puncture the right femoral artery.
     A guide wire and catheter were passed into the right iliac artery into the
     aorta. The guide wire was exchanged for a flush catheter which demonstrated
     the origin of the transplanted artery in the right external iliac artery just
     below the hypoastric.  We were unable to be advanced into the artery.  This
     was exchanged for a SOS Omni  catheter which easily entered the transplanted
     artery. The SOS catheter was changed for a standard Cobra. Because of the
     fistula in the periphery of the renal cortex a tracker catheter was used to
     pass through the segmental arterial branches into the region of the renal
     cortex. An injection of the contrast material localized the AV shunt. The
     shunt was occluded with 500-700 micron sized particles followed by the
     placement of 3, 2 mm coils into the periphery of the upper pole artery.
     Injection following the occlusion demonstrated no flow distally into the
     cortex with no filling of the previously decribed shunt.
     
     CONCLUSION:  Status post embolization of upper pole renal AV shunt. Note
     approximately 80 ml of contrast material were used.

     There is increased diffuse opacities with prominent pulmonary vasculature
     indicating slightly increased moderate degree of congestive heart failure.

     the pulmonary vasculature has been improving. These findings most likely
     represent improving congestive heart failure.
     
     The patient has prior CABG and median sternotomy. There is continued
     cardiomegaly. There is probably a small bilateral pleural effusion.
     
     IMPRESSION: Probable improving congestive heart failure.

     INDICATION:  History of renal transplant, on immunosuppressive medications.
     Two-month history of cough.  Now with worsening shortness of breath and fever.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images were obtained through the chest without
     intravenous contrast.
     
     COMPARISON:  Chest CT from [**2572-12-3**], abdominal CT from [**2575-2-9**], and multiple chest radiographs from the last several days.
     
     CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST:  The heart size is at the upper limits of normal.
     There are diffuse coronary artery calcifications.  Also noted are
     calcifications of the aorta.  Multiple small lymph nodes are identified
     throughout the mediastinum, including an 11-mm precarinal node which contains
     a fatty notch.  There is no significant axillary lymphadenopathy.  There may
     be a tiny left pleural effusion.
     
     Limited evaluation of the upper abdomen reveals evidence for a splenule. There
     is also a high-attenuation lesion within the right adrenal gland which
     measures 12 x 11 mm.  This has been evaluated recently by MRI.
     
     Lung windows demonstrate diffuse, patchy areas of ground-glass opacity
     throughout both lungs, slightly greater on the right than on the left. There
     are small cystic areas in the right upper lobe, with slightly more confluent
     opacity.  There is also mild prominence of the pulmonary vasculature,
     consistent with findings on recent chest radiographs. There is also mild
     centrilobular emphysema, with upper lobe predominance.  The airways are patent
     to the level of the segmental bronchi bilaterally.  There is
     pleural/parenchymal thickening at both lung apices. Also noted is
     atelectasis/scarring at the left lung base. There are several tiny calcified
     lesions in both lower lobes as well as the right upper lobe. These findings
     are consistent with prior granulomatous infection.
     
     Bone windows demonstrate no suspicious lytic or sclerotic abnormalities. There
     are mild degenerative changes of the spine.  The patient is status post median
     sternotomy and CABG.

     1) Diffuse, patchy areas of ground-glass opacity, slightly greater on the
     right than on the left.  Given the findings on recent chest radiographs, these
     findings could be consistent with improving congestive heart failure. However,
     a diffuse infectious process cannot be excluded and clinical correlation is
     suggested.
     
     2) Mild centrilobular emphysema.
     
     3) Small calcified granulomas in the right upper lobe as well as both lower
     lobes, consistent with a prior granulomatous infection.
     
     4) Right adrenal lesion, which has been previously evaluated by MRI.

     PROCEDURE:  The procedure was performed by Drs.[**Last Name (STitle) 1022**] and [**Doctor Last Name 85**], with Dr.[**First Name (STitle) 85**]
     being present and supervising throughout the procedure. The left upper arm was
     prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  As no suitable superficial
     veins were visible, ultrasound was used for localization.  The left brachial
     vein was entered under u/s guidance using a 21 gauge needle.  A .018 guidewire
     was advanced through the needle into the SVC under fluoroscopic guidance.
     Based on the markers on the guidewire, it was determined that a length of 46
     cm would be appropriate.  The catheter was trimmed to length and advanced
     through a 4 French sheath.  The sheath was removed and the catheter was

Mr. [**Known patient lastname 6481**] is a 66 yr old male w/an extensive medical history who recently underwent a kidney transplant [**8-/2575**] complicated by rejection and arteriovenous fistula. Presented to EW [**2-1**] w/general malaise/SOB/chills/fever, hyperglycemia and hyperkalemia.  Pt was initiated on sepsis protocol in EW however it was soon apparent that pt did not appear to be septic and ""MUST"" guidelines were deferred.
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 6481**] did show to have a CHF flare which responded well IV lasix. His right leg has some sl increased redness which will be workup for ?DVT/cellulitus. 

Review of systems;
Neuro: A&Ox3. Discouraged w/repeated hospitalizations which have increased in number since transplant. Quiet, minimal initiation of conversation. Wife, Faith, and daughter state that pt is ""not a complainer"" and known for ""not speaking up."" MAEW, mod strength to UEs

CV: T max 10.3. WBC improved 7.5 (13.2), received po cipro/linezolid and one dose azithromycin. Awaiting ID approval for linezolid.Hct sl decreased to 27.2.

     HISTORY:  66 year old man status post renal transplant with fevers, rigors and
     hematocrit drop.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiple axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were performed
     without IV contrast.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2575-2-9**].
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  The liver, gallbladder, pancreas,
     spleen are normal in appearance.  There is right adrenal fullness, unchanged.
     The native kidneys are atrophic. There are coronary artery calcifications
     again seen. The lung bases show minimal dependent changes.
     
     The opacified stomach, small and large bowel loops are unremarkable.
     
     The transplanted kidney is in the right lower quadrant.  There is a surgical
     clip/coil present in the upper pole of the transplanted kidney.  There are a
     few foci of air in the collecting system in the kidney.  This could be
     consistent with emphysematous pyelitis in the right clinical setting.
     
     Adjacent to the right iliac vein is a 3.9-cm region of low attenuation fluid,
     which is difficult to fully assess on this non-IV-contrast study.  This could
     represent a lymphocele,  with post-op seroma or a retroperitoneal inclusion
     cyst being less likely.
     
     There is a Foley catheter present in the bladder.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH ORAL CONTRAST.  The rectosigmoid colon, prostate are
     normal in appearance.
     
     There is no free air or free fluid in the pelvis.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
