CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Pedestrian struck by a motor vehicle.

HISTORY:  This is an 83 year-old female who was brought to
the emergency room at [**Hospital1 10**] as
a trauma stat having sustained a strike by a motor vehicle.
The patient was extremely unstable in the emergency
department and required endotracheal intubation. The patient
had sustained multiple fractures including fracture of her
pubis which was closed, traumatic pneumothorax, pulmonary
contusion, multiple rib fractures, a fractured scapula, a
fractured medial malleolus. The patient had a past medical
history of hypertension and metastatic breast cancer.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  During the patient's admission she remained
extremely hemodynamically unstable requiring vasopressor
support and massive transfusion. The patient underwent
placement of a pulmonary artery catheter in order to monitor
resuscitation efforts. During the ensuing hours the patient
developed a subendocardial myocardial infarction and became
increasingly more unstable. Despite maximum efforts at
resuscitation the patient became further hemodynamically
unstable and sustained a cardiac arrest from which she could
not be resuscitated. The patient was pronounced dead at 0832
hours.
