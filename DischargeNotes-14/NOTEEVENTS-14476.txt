pneumonia.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 74-year-old female admitted to
[**Hospital3 1141**] on [**3361-4-4**] for pneumonia.  While there
ruled in for myocardial infarction.  The patient was then
given aspirin and Lovenox, and subsequently dropped her
hematocrit from 34 to 23.  She was given 2 units of packed
red blood cells and then developed pulmonary edema subsequent
to the transfusions, was intubated, and became hypotensive
after intubation.  Patient was started on dopamine during
hospital and transferred here to the Intensive Care Unit for
further management.

Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 10**], Medical
Intensive Care Unit, the patient was extubated, remained
stable with hematocrit of 38.2, drifting down to 28.8 with
stable blood pressure.  Of note, the patient was guaiac
positive, but had no bright red blood per rectum, no melena.
She has a history of polyposis with total colectomy, history
of polypectomies, and annual colonoscopy.  She is closely
followed by outpatient gastroenterologist.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Diabetes mellitus on Avandia.
2. Coronary artery disease with myocardial infarction back in
[**3360-11-7**].  At that time, cardiac catheterization
showed three vessel disease in left anterior descending
artery, left circumflex, and right coronary artery, medically
managed was opted at that time.  An echocardiogram showed an
ejection fraction of 45% with apical hypokinesis.
3. Hyperlipidemia.
4. Cholecystectomy.
5. Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
6. Abdominal hernia status post mesh placement.
7. Hypothyroidism.
8. Urinary tract infection.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, she was 100.1
temperature wise, blood pressure was 136/66, heart rate of
92, respiratory rate of 20, and sating 96% on 2 liters.  She
was in no acute distress.  Mucous membranes moist.  Pupils
are equal, round, and reactive to light.  Oropharynx was
clear.  Jugular venous pressure was about 8-9 cm.  She had
coarse breath sounds on the right with egophony, and egophony
and crackles at the left base.  Her heart was regular, rate,
and rhythm, S1, S2 with 3/6 systolic murmur at the apex.
Abdomen was soft with multiple healed scar.  She had
normoactive bowel sounds, nontender abdomen, no clubbing,
cyanosis, or edema of her extremities.  She was alert and
oriented times three.

LABORATORIES:  White count 6.5, hematocrit 27.8, INR 1.2, PTT
38.0.  Sodium 135, potassium 3.4, chloride 105, bicarbonate
20, BUN 22, creatinine 0.9, glucose 121, calcium 8.2,
phosphate 2.9, magnesium 2.3, ALT and AST of 12 and 27, LDH
362, total bilirubin 0.6.  CK 169, alkaline phosphatase 64,
amylase 44.  Urinalysis showed greater than 58 red blood
cells, 0-2 white blood cells, rare bacteria, 0-2 squamous
epithelial cells.  CKs were 159, troponin 7.4, trending down
to CK of 79 and troponin trended down to less than 0.3 by
[**4-7**].  Patient continued to improve with improving O2
saturation.  Her O2 saturation on the day of discharge was
96% on room air.

She remained stable.  Repeat chest x-ray showed congestive
heart failure with some infiltrates.  Patient was given
levofloxacin and Flagyl to cover for community acquired
pneumonia versus aspiration pneumonia.  The patient reports a
history of choking on pills and food, not coughing, but
having trouble swallowing.  She underwent a video swallow
evaluation that showed moderate impairment of upper
esophageal sphincter, however, there was no aspiration.  The
patient was cleared for full po and given tips on how to
avoid choking on her pills.  Patient became afebrile and
remained in stable condition.

Cardiovascularly, CKs and troponins came down.  She was
maintained on aspirin, beta blocker, ACE inhibitor, and
Lasix.  She was given extra doses of Lasix for diuresis.  She
was also given potassium repletion and magnesium repletion.
She opted for medical management for now.  Was kept on
Telemetry without any problems.  She was also given a unit of
packed red blood cells to keep her hematocrit above 30.  Her
hematocrit remained stable thereafter.

Gastrointestinal issues:  Her blood was OB positive, but
there was no gross melena and bright red blood per rectum.
The patient was maintained on Protonix 40 mg po bid and to be
followed up as an outpatient by her gastroenterologist.  She
was maintained on her Avandia and levothyroxine, blood
cultures and urine cultures were pending at the time of
dictation.  Sputum cultures were contaminated with
oropharyngeal flora.

The patient was discharged in stable condition to be followed
up by her primary care physician to get her potassium checked
on Thursday.

      74 year old woman with ?aspiration pneumonia and h/o of choking and coughing

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      ?unilateral pharyngeal paralysis

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: Fluoroscopic guidance for video oropharyngeal swallow.
     
     Fluoroscopic guidance was provided for the swallowing service on patient who
     is a 74 y/o woman with aspiration pneumonia and history of choking and
     coughing while eating. From report from outside hospital of unilateral
     pharyngeal paralysis.
     
     FINDINGS: Patient swallowed thin liquids, nectar thick liquids, pudding, and
     cheerios without evidence of aspiration. There is impaired relaxation of the
     upper esophageal sphincter, but with passage of liquids and cheerios with
     slight hold up. There is a small amount of residual within the valleculae
     after pudding. This clears well with thin liquids. There is symmetric movement
     of the valleculae and vocal folds bilaterally.
     
     IMPRESSION: Impaired relaxation of the upper esophageal sphincter. No evidence
     of aspiration. For details of this study, and description of oropharyngeal and
     laryngeal motility, please see the full report from the swallowing service.
