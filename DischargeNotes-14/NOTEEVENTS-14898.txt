Date of Birth:  [**2562-4-26**]        Sex:  M

Service:  TRANSPLANT SURGERY


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 62-year-old male with end-
stage liver disease, cirrhosis secondary to alcohol,
encephalopathy, peripheral edema, ascites requiring
paracentesis, upper gastrointestinal bleed from grade 2
varices one time, portal hypertension hepatocellular
carcinoma non-metastatic, status post radiofrequency ablation
in [**2623-11-10**], followed for availability of liver
transplant.  The patient is without new complaints at the
time of admission.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Lasix 40 mg once a day.
2. Lactulose one tablespoon once a day.
3. Propranolol 40 mg twice a day.
4. Lithium 900 mg once a day.
5. Protonix 40 mg twice a day.
6. Spironolactone 100 mg twice a day.
7. Mycelex five.
8. Meclizine 25 mg once a day.
9. NPH insulin 100 units q. a.m., 50 units q. p.m.
10.      Doxazosin 1 mg once a day.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Upon admission this patient was
afebrile with stable vital signs with a weight of 120.0
kilograms.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination was
normal.  Neck was supple.  Lungs clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Cardiovascular examination:  Regular rate and
rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Abdominal examination:
Revealed mild ascites, non-tender throughout.  Extremity
examination revealed 1 plus ankle edema.

LABORATORY ON ADMISSION:  Hematocrit 38.5, white blood cell
count 11.2, platelet count 140,000.  Sodium 143, potassium
3.4, chloride 103, carbon dioxide 34, blood urea nitrogen 16,
creatinine 1.0, glucose level 50.  Calcium 10.0, phosphorus
82.6, magnesium 1.6.  AST was 61, ALT was 52 and alk phos was
83.  Total bilirubin was 1.7.  His prothrombin time was 14.3,
his PTT was 26.4.  His fibrinogen was 267 and his INR was
1.4.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  So at this time the patient was admitted
with end-stage liver disease for a liver transplant.  He was
placed nil per os.  Consent was signed.  CellCept, Solu-
Medrol, Unasyn, fluconazole were started.  Labs were drawn.
Urinalysis was performed.  A chest x-ray was performed and an
electrocardiogram was performed.  Anesthesia consent was also
obtained as he was seen by their staff.

On [**2624-5-25**], liver transplant was performed under
general anesthesia.  The patient was brought to the Surgical
Intensive Care Unit after the operation.  The patient was
progressing well at this time and on postoperative day one
the plan was to use morphine sulfate for pain as needed.  A
transesophageal echocardiogram had shown residual clot and
adequate biventricular function.  A chest x-ray was sent and
the patient was weaned off of FiO2.  The patient was also nil
per os at this time and on an nasogastric tube.  The patient
was also on a Foley catheter to follow urine output closely.
Infectious Disease:  The patient was placed on Unasyn times
three days.  The patient was also transfused platelets, fresh
frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate at this time and the
patient began the immunosuppressive regimen with Solu-Medrol
at 140 twice a day, CellCept 1 gram twice a day, ________
times one intraoperatively and, in terms of endocrine,
patient was placed on a regular insulin sliding scale at this
time with a plan to move to an insulin drip if glucose levels
trended upwards.  The patient continued to progress well
during his stay and continued to oxygenate well and was able
to be weaned off of oxygen, FiO2 as he was weaned off of
propofol at this time.  Prophylactic medications, Bactrim and
fluconazole, were continued at this time.

The patient continued to progress well at this time and on
the [**5-27**] propofol was discontinued.  An
electrocardiogram was taken showing no ischemic changes.  The
patient did not need a beta blocker at this time.  Patient
was receiving Nipride which was being held for systolic blood
pressure less than 160.  The patient was given Lasix to
diurese and established an adequate urine output.  The
patient was started on total parenteral nutrition and Unasyn
was discontinued at this time.

On [**2624-5-28**], the patient continued to progress taking
Dilaudid p.r.n. for pain at this time.  Stable vital signs.
Patient receiving CPAP and his total bilirubin and other
liver function tests including ALT and AST continued to trend
downward.  Good bile output out of the drain.  His liver
function tests on this day were 155 for AST, 614 for ALT and
64 for alk phos.  The previous day on [**5-27**] were AST of
252, ALT of 309 and alk phos of 65.  The patient was
continued on Lasix diuresis and continued on prophylactic
Bactrim, fluconazole and ganciclovir.  The patient at this
time was on an insulin drip.

The patient continued to progress on the [**5-29**] and was
being followed at this time by the inpatient clinical
Nutrition team.  They recommended titrating insulin drip as
needed and set up a TPN to regiment with a goal of 2,150
kilocalories per day.

On [**2624-5-30**], the patient continued to progress well.
His wound was noted to be without pus or erythema at this
time.  He was continued on Dilaudid as needed for pain.  He
was still being followed by the SICU team in the Surgical
Intensive Care Unit.  At this time patient was able to change
to largely oral medications.  He had stable respiratory
status and was now off of ventilation.

On postoperative day nine, [**6-1**], the patient continued
to be stable but appeared somewhat confused upon examination.
It was recommended at this time the patient be transferred to
the floor and later in the day he was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 455**] 10.
Date of extubation for this patient was [**5-30**].  The
patient began to be evaluated by Physical Therapy on [**2624-5-31**].

On [**2624-6-2**], it was noted they found the patient to be
alert and oriented but mildly inappropriate with tangential
speech.  They noting that he was practicing even coordinated
breathing.  Their general impression was that this man's
mobility would improve.  He was tolerating being out-of-bed
well but that he would require short term rehabilitation upon
discharge to maximize functional status.  They also stated
that his potential to return to baseline was good.  They
recommended one to three more weeks of physical therapy or
until discharge to rehabilitation.

The patient began to be followed by the [**Last Name (un) 720**] consult team
on the [**6-3**].  The [**Last Name (un) 720**] attending noted that the
patient was now transitioning to eating meals and suggested
starting Lentes and Humalog regimen.  As per their request
after they reviewed the chart they noted that his prior
regimen was likely suboptimal and that his insulin needs
would be significantly different after this liver
transplantation due to the effects of steroids and his new
liver and they began to discuss outpatient regimens for the
patient.  The patient was also receiving Occupational Therapy
evaluations and it was noted on [**2624-6-3**], by
Occupational Therapy that patient was minimally confused and
that he would likely need rehabilitation prior to returning
home.

On the [**6-4**] the patient continued to progress well,
complained of some mild abdominal pain but noted significant
improvement since the immediate postoperative time.  There
were noted to be multiple ecchymotic areas over his right
upper extremity at this time and four to five skin
ulcerations on his left upper extremity.  Ancef 1 gram every
eight hours was started at this time and a full HUS workup
was commenced and Hematology was consulted.  A blood smear
was sent that was viewed by Hematology not to contain any
schistocytes and that most likely a hemolytic-uremic syndrome
workup was not necessarily warranted but that they would
follow the results.

On postoperative day 12, [**6-5**], the patient continued to
progress well and began to be screened for rehabilitation.
He continued to be followed by [**Last Name (un) 720**] for glucose levels and
was continued on Ancef at this time.  His vital signs were
stable and the patient was without pain at this time.  He was
passing gas and having bowel movements and was noted an
increased appetite.  The patient continued to be followed by
Nutrition, Respiratory Care and his liver function tests
continued to trend downwards.  Cyclosporin levels were found
to be therapeutic and it was determined again by Transplant
staff that the patient would likely need rehabilitation.
[**Last Name (un) 720**] continued to follow the patient at this time and
recommended that the patient continue with current Lentes and
Humalog sliding scale regimen.

On the [**6-7**] the patient was doing well with only mild
abdominal pain with lunging or reaching movements.  He was
still passing gas and having bowel movements and taking solid
foods at this time.  The patient still appeared somewhat
distant in conversation and a Psychiatry consult was ordered.
Per Psychiatry's request, the lithium level was sent and
found to be 1.9.  At this time Psychiatry recommended that
lithium be held and Haldol be used as needed for agitation.
At this time it was noted that the patient was not taking
enough food orally and a feeding tube was placed by
Interventional Radiology.

Then on the morning of [**2624-6-9**], the patient went on to
pull the feeding tube from its position and it was determined
that total parenteral nutrition would be delivered through a
PICC line placed on the [**2624-6-8**].  The patient
continued to improve at this time and was followed again by
Psychiatry who suggested 1 mg dose of Haldol for standing
order at night and their formal consultation was noted in the
chart.  The patient's mental status was significant for
confusion and inattention and tangential thought at this
time.  His lithium level and renal function were noted to be
improving at this time.  His lithium level was now down to
1.6.

On [**6-10**] the patient continued to feel better and continued
to note improving appetite.  He was noted by the staff to be
taking all of his meals.  Calorie counts were occurring at
this time.  The patient continued to be screened for
rehabilitation.  The patient was continued on total
parenteral nutrition.  [**Last Name (un) 720**] was notified of the total
parenteral nutrition and they advised adding 10 units of
insulin to his TPN order which was done.

On [**6-11**], the day of discharge, the patient was doing very
well, not complaining of any pain, with increasing appetite.
Had been out-of-bed three times the previous day.  On
physical examination vital signs were temperature maximum
over the last 24 hours of 98.4 degrees.  Current temperature
97.6 degrees.  59 beats per minute.  Blood pressure 132/71.
Respiratory rate of 20.  Oxygen saturation 94 percent on room
air.  His weight was 123.3 kilograms.  His fingersticks were
in the low 100's.  The patient was in no apparent distress.
His cardiac examination revealed regular rate and rhythm with
no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  His respiratory examination
revealed clear to auscultation bilaterally.  No wheezes,
rales or rhonchi.  On abdominal examination the patient was
noted to be non-distended, normoactive bowel sounds, soft and
non-tender throughout with a well-healing wound.  It was
clean, dry and intact.  Screening for rehabilitation at this
time continued and it was determined that patient would be
discharged on this day.

His laboratory values at this time were the following:  PT
time 12.5, PTT 22.4, INR 1.0, fibrinogen 431.  On [**2624-6-10**], his cyclosporin level was 944.  His liver function
tests revealed an ALT of 14, an AST of 15, alk phos of 127, a
total bilirubin of 1.8 and albumin of 2.8.  White count at
this time was 12.9, hematocrit 27.6 and platelet count
137,000.

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:

                                     FINAL REPORT
     The patient needs a long term antibiotics and TPN. Please place a double lumen
     PICC line. IV therapy was not able to place the line at the bedside.
     
     PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4005**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 510**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 250**],
     the Attending Radiologist, who was present and supervising. The right upper
     arm was prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion. Since no suitable
     superficial veins were visible, ultrasound was used for localization of a
     suitable vein. The right basilic vein was patent and compressible.  After
     local anesthesia with 3 cc of 1% lidocaine, the basilic was entered under
     ultrasonographic guidance with a 21 gauge needle. Hard copies of ultrasound
     images were obtained documenting patent vein before and after establishing an
     access. Initially a 0.18 guidewire was advanced under fluoroscopy, however,
     this could only be advanced to the level of the axilla. This was then
     exchanged for a short Nintonal wire which also could not be advanced beyond
     the axilla.  A 5 French introducer sheath was introduced into the vein and a
     hand injection venogram was performed.  This demonstrated occlusion of the
     axillary vein as it enters the subclavian with a large colateral coursing
     around into the SVC. A 0.18 glidewire was then used to course the catheter
     through the colateral into the SVC.  Fluoroscopic guidance was used. The PICC
     line was trimmed to a length of 45 cm and advanced over the 5 French
     introducer sheath through the colateral under fluoroscopic guidance into the
     SVC. The sheath was removed. The catheter was flushed, a final chest x-ray was
     obtained and demonstrates the tip to be in the SVC just above the atrium. The
     SVC position was confirmed by injecting contrast. The line is ready for use.
     
     A stat lock was applied and the line was hep locked.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a 45 cm double lumen total length PICC
     line with the tip in the SVC. The line is ready for use.

     superficial veins were visible, ultrasound was used for localization of a
     suitable vein. The right basilic vein was patent and compressible.  After
     local anesthesia with 3 cc of 1% lidocaine, the basilic was entered under
     ultrasonographic guidance with a 21 gauge needle. Hard copies of ultrasound
     images were obtained documenting patent vein before and after establishing an
     access. Initially a 0.18 guidewire was advanced under fluoroscopy, however,
     this could only be advanced to the level of the axilla. This was then
     exchanged for a short Nintonal wire which also could not be advanced beyond
     the axilla.  A 5 French introducer sheath was introduced into the vein and a
     hand injection venogram was performed.  This demonstrated occlusion of the
     axillary vein as it enters the subclavian with a large colateral coursing
     around into the SVC. A 0.18 glidewire was then used to course the catheter
     through the colateral into the SVC.  Fluoroscopic guidance was used. The PICC
     line was trimmed to a length of 45 cm and advanced over the 5 French
     introducer sheath through the colateral under fluoroscopic guidance into the
     SVC. The sheath was removed. The catheter was flushed, a final chest x-ray was
     obtained and demonstrates the tip to be in the SVC just above the atrium. The
     SVC position was confirmed by injecting contrast. The line is ready for use.
     
     A stat lock was applied and the line was hep locked.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a 45 cm double lumen total length PICC
     line with the tip in the SVC. The line is ready for use.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Left lower lobe pneumonia, desaturations, possible intra-
     abdominal process.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Chest CTA technique was used.  Precontrast and contrast enhanced
     images were obtained of the chest.  Multiplanar reformatted images were
     obtained.  Delayed images were obtained through the abdomen and pelvis.  150
     cc Optiray contrast were administered.  Nonionic contrast was used secondary
     to CTA technique and patient's debility.
     
     CHEST CT WO/W IV CONTRAST:  The contrast enhanced images are somewhat degraded
     by artifact.  The main branches of the pulmonary arteries are adequately
     visualized.  There are no filling defects within the main branches.  Within
     several of the segmental branches there are punctate low density foci.  These
     may represent small emboli vs. artifact.
     
     A large area of consolidation is present in the left lower lobe.  There are
     small bilateral pleural effusions.  Right lower lobe atelectasis is present.
     
     ABDOMEN CT W/IV CONTRAST:  No focal liver masses are present.  There is a
     drain within the common bile duct which exits at the mid abdomen.  Limited
     assessment of the liver vasculature on this single phase study demonstrates no
     gross abnormalities.  Normal flow is present within the hepatic vessels.
     
     A right posterior perihepatic subdiaphragmatic fluid collection is present.
     This measures 3.8 X 6.3 cm in greatest cross sectional diameter and contains
     several bubbles of gas at its superior aspect under the diaphragm.  The fluid
     extends along the posterior aspect of the liver.  No fluid collections are
     seen along the anterior liver or in the subhepatic region.  Irregular soft
     tissue stranding and fat stranding is present within the anterior abdominal
     wall.  There is a large defect consistent with history of wound dehiscence.
     Several bubbles of gas are present within the abdominal wall consistent with
     recent surgery/debridement.  A tiny focal collection is present at the midline
     which measures 2.0 X 1.3 cm.
     
     The stomach, small bowel, and large bowel are normal.  The spleen is enlarged
     and there is a tiny amount of perisplenic fluid.  Innumerable portal and
     retroperitoneal lymph nodes are present.  The largest is in the left para-
                                                                 (Over)

     1)  No pulmonary embolism within the main pulmonary arterial branches.  Within
     several segmental pulmonary arterial branches there are punctate low density
     foci.  These may represent artifact.  However, small pulmonary emboli cannot

      pt s/p liver transplant now with elevated LFTs. CT with po contrast to evaluate
      for fluid collections and to assess vessel patency.  
      Note: pt has a tracheostomy- off vent during the daytime
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Elevated LFTs, status post liver transplant.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2624-8-10**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images CT images of the abdomen and pelvis were
     obtained.  The abdomen was imaged in multiple phases of contrast
     administration.
     
     CONTRAST:  Oral and 150 cc of IV Optiray was administered.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is a stable small left
     effusion with left basilar atelectasis.  The right lung base is unremarkable.
     
     Again noted is a right posterior perihepatic  fluid collection measuring 2.3 x
     5.3 cm.  This fluid collection extends along the posterior aspect of the liver
     and is unchanged in appearanceand does not contain gas.  There is normal blood
     flow in the liver including hepatic arteries, hepatic and portal veins.  There
     are no perfusion defects within the liver.  A small area of low attenuation is
     visualized in the right lobe seen on series 4, image 28.  It is unchanged in
     appearance and too small to characterize.  The spleen, pancreas, adrenals,
     kidneys, ureters and the abdominal loops of small and large bowel are
     unremarkable.  Multiple periaortic lymph nodes are again seen.  These are
     stable in size and do not fulfill the CT criteria for lymphadenopathy.  There
     is no free air.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The pelvic loops of small and large bowel
     appear normal.  The urinary bladder, prostate and seminal vesicles appear
     unremarkable.  There is no free air or free fluid.  There is no pelvic or
     inguinal lymphadenopathy.
     
     There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions in the osseous structures.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Stable right posterior perihepatic fluid collection.  Normal
     liver perfusion.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     STUDY:  Ultrasound-guided liver biopsy.
     
     INDICATION:  Patient with hepatitis C.  Transplanted liver.  To rule out
     rejection.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Abdominal ultrasound was performed initially.  Suitable spot for
     liver biopsy was identified.  A preprocedural timeout was performed to confirm
     patient identity and indication for examination.  The patient was cleansed and
     draped in a standard fashion.  Using direct sonographic visualization, an 18-
     gauge core sample was taken from the right lobe of the liver.  The patient
     tolerated the procedure well, and there were no immediate complications.
     
     CONCLUSION:
     
     Successful ultrasound-guided liver biopsy.  The attending, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2742**], was
     present throughout the procedure.

     ULTRASOUND-GUIDED CORE LIVER BIOPSY:  Comparison made to prior study of
     [**2624-12-22**].  Signed informed consent was obtained.  Preprocedure
     timeout was performed and scans were done which demonstrated an appropriate
     spot for biopsy in the intercostal space in the mid axillary line. The area
     was marked and then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The 7 mL
     of 1% lidocaine was injected into the subcutaneous tissues.  Under ultrasound
     guidance, an 18- gauge core biopsy was obtained.  The sample was sent to
     pathology for analysis.
     
     There are no immediate post-procedure complications, and the patient tolerated
     the procedure well.  The attending physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 527**]. [**First Name (STitle) 2742**], was present and

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Status post liver transplant for HCC.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2624-3-17**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contrast enhanced chest CT.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     A tracheostomy tube is in place.  There is no axillary lymphadenopathy.  A
     pretracheal node measuring 11 mm is present, and there are enlarged nodes in
     the left hilum.  Small pericardial lymph nodes appear unchanged.  Persistent
     elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is again noted.  Limited images of the
     upper abdomen demonstrate four small peripheral low-density lesions within the
     liver, too small to definitively characterize.  Additionally, a soft tissue
     density adjacent to the right posterior aspect of the liver is noted.
     Collection posterior to the right lobe is unchanged. There is extensive
     gynecomastia, unchanged.
     
     Assessment of the lung parenchyma demonstrates new peripheral nodular
     opacities, most notable in the left upper lobe.  Additionally, there is
     atelectasis and possible consolidation in the left lower lobe.  The exam is
     extremely limited by expiratory phase and breathing artifact, so small nodules
     could be missed.  The airways appear patent.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions are evident.
     
     Coronally reformatted images redemonstrate the above findings.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  New nodular patchy parenchymal opacities in the left upper lobe with left
     hilar adenopathy and precarinal adenopathy.  Atelectasis and possible
     consolidation in the lingula.  These findings most likely represent an
     infectious etiology, but a 6-week short-term followup chest CT after treatment
     is recommended to ensure that they resolve and to exclude atypical mets.
     2)  Four small low-density lesions within the liver, too small to definitively
     characterize.
     3)  Small collection posterior to the right aspect of the liver, stable.
     
     
                                                                 (Over)

     INDICATION:  Liver transplant.  Lesions noted on recent chest CT.
     
     COMPARISON:  Chest CT [**2625-1-31**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  CT of the abdomen and pelvis before and after the administration
     of 100 cc Optiray nonionic contrast due to elevated creatinine.  Oral contrast
     was not used.  The contrast bolus is slightly suboptimal.
     
     Abdomen with contrast:  There is a 7 mm subpleural nodular density at the
     right lung base, new in the interval.  No other nodules are visible.  No
     images of the left lung base has been included due to elevation of the left
     hemidiaphragm and elevation of the spleen and stomach into the left lower
     chest.  There are four small low- density lesions within the liver, unchanged
     in size and appearance since the previous exam.  No new lesions are visible.
     The spleen is enlarged. The pancreas is atrophic.  There is suture material
     about the IVC.  The adrenal glands and kidneys are within normal limits. There
     are small retroperitoneal lymph nodes measuring up to 8 mm in greatest short
     axis dimension, unchanged. The bowel is not well assessed without oral
     contrast material.  There is some free fluid.  There is a stable collection
     posterior to the right lobe of the liver. 
     
     PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The bladder, prostate gland, seminal vesicles, and
     pelvic loops of bowel are grossly unremarkable.  There is no inguinal or deep
     trace free pelvic fluid.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Four small low-density lesions within the liver, unchanged in size and
     appearance since 2/2005.
     2.  Stable collection posterior to the right lobe of the liver.
     3.  A 7 mm nodular density at the right lung base, is new in the interval. 3
     month follow-up chest CT is recommended to document stability or resolution.
