     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      67 year old man with mds and thallesemia.  acute right upper quadrant pain. hx 
      of gall stones. 
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      r/o cholangitis

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  67-year-old man with myelodysplastic syndrome and thalassemia,
     now with acute right upper quadrant pain.
     
     COMPARISONS:  None.
     
     FINDINGS:  The liver shows no focal or textural abnormalities.  No focal
     masses are identified within the liver.  There is a tiny rounded hypoechoic
     area seen in the right liver consistent with simple cyst.  A small hyperechoic
     focus is seen within the gallbladder consistent with stone.  Some sludge is
     also seen within the gallbladder and there is a tiny amount of gallbladder
     wall edema with some distention of the gallbladder.  The common duct appears
     within normal range for patient's age.  The right kidney measures 10.7 cm. The
     left kidney measures 10.4 cm.  There is no hydronephrosis or stones.  The
     spleen appears enlarged, measuring approximately 20 cm.  The tail of pancreas
     is not well visualized, however, the head of the pancreas appears
     unremarkable. Where visualized, the aorta appears of normal caliber.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Gallstone and some sludge seen within the gallbladder, along with a
     minimal amount of wall edema.  These findings may be seen in a number of
     conditions including conditions that cause third spacing of fluid or possibly
     cholecystitis.  Clinical correlation is suggested.
     
     2.  Splenomegaly.
     
     3.  Simple liver cyst.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Right upper quadrant pain and elevated bilirubin in patient with
     myelodysplastic syndrome.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar HASTE, axial T1 in- and out-of-phase, axial STIR, 2D
     time-of-flight, slab T2 cholangiogram imaging, as well as 3D fat sat T1-
     weighted imaging without and with intravenous contrast.
     
     Comparison is made to a prior ultrasound performed on [**2855-10-14**].
     
     FINDINGS:  There is diffuse low signal intensity within the liver and spleen
     that is consistent with iron deposition from prior blood transfusions
     (hemosiderosis).  A 5 millimeter hemangioma is identified within the inferior
     right lobe of the liver.  No other liver lesions or intra or extrahepatic
     biliary ductal dilatation is seen.  No filling defects are identified within
     the common duct.  The spleen is enlarged.  A small amount of intra-abdominal
     ascites is seen.  The visualized portions of both kidneys, the adrenal glands,
     the pancreas, and the visualized portions of bowel are within normal limits.
     
     There is diffuse gallbladder wall edema with several small gallstones
     measuring less than 5 mm in greatest dimension.  There is no evidence of
     hyperemia within the hepatic parenchyma of the adjacent gallbladder fossa(a
     specific sign of acute cholecystitis). Some increased enhancement is seen
     within the gallbladder wall with no evidence of necrosis.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Cholelithiasis with gallbladder wall edema and gallbladder distention.
     These findings are nonspecific and could be seen with acute cholecystitis or
     as a sequela of the patient's known hypoalbuminemia, liver dysfunction, or
     hypervolemia.
     2.  Hemosiderosis.
     3.  Splenomegaly.

     HISTORY:  Febrile, question infection.
     
     CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
     
     The heart is not enlarged.  The lungs are hyperinflated and there is
     distortion of the parenchyma, consistent with COPD.  There is patchy opacity
     at left greater than right bases, with a background reticular nodular pattern.
     No frank consolidation, CHF or effusion is identified.  A 10-mm nodular
     density overlies the right lung base, new or better appreciated on today's
     exam.  Tiny density in the right upper zone peripherally is less well
     appreciated on today's study. Mild prominence of hila is noted.
     Although the mdiastinum is not enlarged, the [**2855-2-9**] CT scan described some
     mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
     
     IMPRESSIONl
     
     1) Patchy opacities - differential diagnosis includes scarring or early
     infiltrate.  Possibility of an atypical infectious [**Doctor Last Name 116**] should be considered.
     Recommend followup imaging to confirm resolution.
     
     2) CT may be helpful to further assess the nodular density at the right base.

Pertinent Results:
CT head [**11-3**]: No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
.
CXR [**11-3**]: IMPRESSION: Possible new small area of consolidation 
in region of lingula at site of chronic change in this location. 
Correlate clinically and with follow up after therapy if there 
is clinical suggestion of new pneumonia. 
.
CXR [**11-5**]: IMPRESSION: Worsening multifocal opacity indicating 
invasive aspergillosis. Mild volume overload or pulmonary edema.
.
CT chest [**11-5**]: IMPRESSION: Multifocal confluent opacities 
bilaterally, with an appearance consistent with a multifocal 
bronchopneumonia. There are associated small bilateral pleural 
effusions and multiple prominent mediastinal lymph[**MD Number 285**].

Brief Hospital Course:
# Fever and neutropenia - pt presented with fever to 102's, 
associated with cough, which patient attributes to seasonal 
asthma exacerbation. Initial CXR showed an early LLL infiltrate 
suspicious for pneumonia.  He was started on cefepime and 
azithromycin.  He continued to be febrile and vancomycin was 
added.  After patient continued to be febrile for 2 days, a 
repeat CXR was performed showing progression of the LLL process 
as well as a new infiltrate in the RUL, concerning for a fungal 
process.  Pt was started on Ambisome after several sputums were 
sent as well as serum antigens for histoplasma, galactomannan, 
and aspergillus.  In addition, pulmonary consult was obtained 
and patient was scheduled for bronchoscopy.  Broncoscopy did not 
provide definitive diagnosis, and pt's multifocal pneumonia 
continued to progress (by CXR and CT).  The pneumonia was then 
thought to be secondary to invasive aspergillosis by its 
appearance on CT.  A previously sent galacomannin then came back 
positive, and the pt was started on double coverage for fungal 
infection with ambisome and voriconazole.  The dose of the 
voriconazole was titrated upward per infectious disease 
recommendations.  Pt had been on meropenem for febrile 
neutropenia, however this was d/c'd, as it was not providing 
clear benefit.  Pt was continued on levofloxacin and 
prophylactic doses of bactrim.  His lung disease progressed, and 
the pt had increasing episodes of hemoptysis for which he 
received frequent platelet transfusions.  In the days prior to 
his death, he had 2 blood culture bottle growing 
corynebacterium, and vancomycin was started until sensitivities 
returned.  He continued to have temperature elevations to 102 
without any other sources identified on blood/urine cultures or 
on imaging.  
.
# ATMDS - continued on low dose prednisone and support of blood 
counts with transfusions for Hct <25 and plt <50 (for active 
hemoptysis).  Initially this was increased to 5mg PO TID for the 
worsening pulmonary status, however this was reduced to 5mg 
daily after he complained of hallucinations and an ""expanded 
mind."" These symptoms resolved after 0.5 mg of zyprexa daily for 
3 days.  In addition, we continued his maintenance dose of 
allopurinol.  Pt's ANC did not recover, and he remained 
neutropenic during the admission, spiking frequent fevers.  He 
was given doses of GCSF and GM-CSF, without improvement.  
.
# Hypoxia - had acute exacerbation from invasive aspergillosis 
infxn. Required IV steroids and had improved initially - given 
for a little more than 24hrs.  Then switched to PO prednisone 
60mg qd and planned to taper over 2 weeks.  However, w/ decrease 
to 40mg over 3 days, had worsening respiratory function.  He 
required a higher dose of predisone, ATC nebs and IV lasix to 
keep his O2 sat >90%.  In the day prior to his death, his O2 sat 
dropped from 95% on 3L NC to 97% on NRB.  
.
# confusion - Pt had multiple instances when he was thought to 
be confused by his family and nursing staff.  Pt denied being 
confused or having any difficulty w/ speaking.  On exam, he had 
no neurologic deficits and feels well.  Stroke was unlikely as 
he has no risk factors (htn, diabetes, hyperlipidemia) except 
for his age; in addition, he had no residual deficits.  He was 
noted, however, to be hyponatremic at 131.  He had a few low 
values during this admission, but mostly was in normal ranges.  
Urine Osm >100 and urine Na >40 which suggests euvolemic 
hyponatremia from SIADH.  Both sodium level and mental status 
improved w/ free fluid restriction.
.
# elevated INR:  Pt's INR persistently ranged from 1.3 - 1.7 
despite multiple doses of vit K in oral/SC/IV forms.  Possible 
that his liver was not utilizing vitamin K to produce 
coagulation factors.
.
# Scalp abrasion - pt scraped his head on the way to the 
hospital.  He denied any pain, although did have some ongoing 
oozing.  Given his thrombocytopenia, a head CT was done, which 
was negative for any head bleeds.  He received platelets and the 
bleeding stopped.
.
--FEN - neutropenic diet, repleted lytes as needed
.
--PPX - ambulate, bactrim
.  
--Code: DNR/DNI - pt died after having increasing oxygen 
requirement, pain, decreasing blood pressure, and he became 
unarousable.  Morphine drip was started w/ consent from HCP, 
wife [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 10362**] [**Known patient lastname 10363**], and he died within several hours.

     COMPARISON:  [**2855-11-9**] and [**2854-9-1**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT-acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     thoracic inlet through the pubic symphysis.
     
     CONTRAST:  100 cc of IV Optiray contrast was administered due to the rapid
     rate of bolus injection required for this study.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  Soft tissue window images demonstrate
     multiple mediastinal lymph nodes, in the right peritracheal, paraortic,
     pretracheal, subcarinal, and paraesophageal positions.  Additionally, there
     are lymph nodes present in the perihilar areas.  Several of these are enlarged
     by CT criteria.  The largest of these is in the subcarinal position, measuring
     3.6 x 1.6 cm.  Bilateral small pleural effusions are noted.  The great vessels
     in the heart are normal in appearance.  Lung window images demonstrate
     multiple areas of confluent opacities bilaterally, in the upper and lower
     lobes.  Additionally, chronic changes within the left lingula are again seen.
     There are several areas of tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 793**] opacity noted in the right upper lobe
     as well.
     
     There are limited images of the superior abdominal structures.  There are
     several hypodensities within the liver, and a single hypodensity within the
     spleen which are too small to characterize, both were present on the prior
     study of [**2854-9-1**] and are unchanged.  The limited portions of the adrenal
     glands, kidneys, pancreas, and gallbladder that are visualized are

     CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST:
     
     INDICATION:  67-year-old man with fever and neutropenia.
     
     COMMENTS:  Unenhanced CT scan of the chest was performed without the
     administration of contrast media.  Spiral CT scan was performed encompassing
     both lungs.
     
     Comparison was made with the previous CT scan dated [**2855-11-5**].
     
     The previously identified bilateral multifocal consolidation has progressed.
     Bilateral multifocal opacities involving the left lower lobe, left upper lobe,
     right upper lobe, right middle lobe and right lower lobe have increased. There
     is increased bilateral pleural effusion.  In this patient with neutropenia,
     these findings most likely indicate invasive aspergillosis, which has
     progressed.
     
     There is small pericardial effusion.  There are multiple scattered lymph nodes
     throughout the mediastinum, which were present in the previous study.  The
     bilateral pleural effusion appears somewhat loculated.
     
     Again, note is made of mild coronary artery calcification.
     
     Again, note is made of marked splenomegaly, which is there due to the
     patient's underlying disorder.
     
     No apparent osseous abnormality is identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Progression of bilateral multifocal pneumonia, probably invasive
     aspergillosis in this patient with neutropenia.  Increased bilateral pleural
     effusion, which is somewhat loculated.
     
     The information was communicated with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7895**].
     
     ADDENDUM:  Again, note is made of a small low density area within the right
     lobe of the liver, which is not changed.  There are several small gallstones
     within the gallbladder.
                                                                 (Over)

     AP CHEST 11:04 A.M. [**11-16**].
     
     HISTORY:  Neutropenia.  Line placement.
     
     IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**11-10**]:
     
     New left PICC line, tip in the SVC.
     
     Much more severe consolidation has developed in both the lingula and right
     upper lobe obscuring previous small discrete linear and nodular opacities.
     Small bilateral pleural effusions are stable on the right and increased on the
     left and there is new perihilar opacification seen in the left upper lung
     which may represent moderate pulmonary edema rather than additional foci of
     infection.  Cardiac silhouette is no larger than it was previously, either
     normal or mildly enlarged.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7897**] and I discussed these findings, at
     the time of dictation.

     INDICATION:  67-year-old man with MDS and neutropenia.
     
     COMMENTS:  Portable erect AP radiograph of the chest is reviewed, and compared
     with the previous study of [**11-20**]. 2005.
     
     The tip of the left-sided PICC line is identified in the superior vena cava. 
     No pneumothorax is identified.
     
     There is slight increase in mild congestive heart failure with cardiomegaly
     and small bilateral pleural effusion.  There is continued bilateral multifocal
     opacity involving the left lower lobe, right upper lobe, and right lower lobe
     indicating invasive aspergillosis in this patient with neutropenia.
