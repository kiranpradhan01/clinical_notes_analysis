Brief Hospital Course:
76 y/o man w/severe CHF admitted w/dyspnea and UTI.  
.  
# Dyspnea: Actually was felt to be euvolemic to possibly volume 
depleted on admission. There was concern for early septic 
physiology given high WBC and borderline BPs. He received IVF in 
the ED and his BP stabilized at his baseline 90-100s systolic. 
His diuretics and other heart failure medications were initially 
held [**1-20**] hypotension and concern for sepsis, but they were added 
back slowly. At d/c he was back on carvedilol and Torsemide. 
Losartan 25mg was held due to asyptomatically low blood 
pressures, ** and this should be added back as tolerated. He was 
without an oxygen requirement on discharge. CXR was clear for 
CHF. Dyspnea was felt to be [**1-20**] to phsyical deconditioning and 
acute UTI/C-diff.
.  
# ICD firing: Tracings from ED show polymorphic VT. Digoxin 
level supratherapeutic on admission and was held. Digoxin was 
re-started, but dose adjusted to 0.125mg PO every third day. 
Levels should be monitored closely. Cardiac Electrophysiology 
team  interrogated ICD and was found to be functioning normally. 
 Has follow up appointment scheduled with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 1259**] for 
VT ablation 
.  
# UTI: U/A was grossly positive w/25 urine WBC and elevated WBC 
on CBC. Initially covered with Vanco and Levoflox but given pt's 
clinical stability vancomycin d/c'ed. Urine culture grew 
resistnat Ecoli and there was concern for prostatitis given 
large tender prostate on exam. He will be treated with a 14 days 
course of Zosyn. 
.  
C-diff: stool cx posative for C-diff. Flagyl PO started. He 
should remain on flagyl for the course of his zosyn treatment 
and then for 2 weeks after.   
.  
# elevated INR - though to be [**1-20**] nutritional deficiencies. 
.

     CLINICAL HISTORY:  76-year-old male with dyspnea on exertion, positive D-
     dimer.  Evaluate for pulmonary embolus.
     
     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast and contrast-enhanced multidetector CT-acquired axial
     images of the chest.  Multiplanar reformatted images were obtained.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST:  The lungs are clear.  There is bilateral patchy ground glass
     opacity and dependent atelectasis.  Multiple calcified granulomas are seen
     within the right lung. No filling defect is identified within the pulmonary
     arteries. Main pulmonary artery is dilated, measures 3.6 cm in maximal
     dimensions. There is focal aneurysm of the proximal pulmonary artery. The
     aorta remains unopacified. The heart is enlarged and IVC is dilated. Calcified
     atherosclerotic plaques are seen throughout the aorta and coronary arteries.
     Leads from an AICD are in standard position.  No pericardial or pleural
     effusion is detected.  The airways remain patent. Multiple enlarged
     mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes are present.
     
     Osseous structures demonstrate no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesion. There
     is irregularity of the T7-T8 endplates, which is mostly likely degenerative in
     nature, however diskitis cannot be totally excluded, and therfore recommend
     correlation with clinical findings. Visualized upper abdomen demonstrates
     atherosclerotic calcifications within the celiac, superior mesenteric and
     splenic arteries. 
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolus.

     COMPARISON:  [**3065-3-6**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT scanning of the chest was performed without and
     with intravenous contrast.  Multiplanar reformations were obtained.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST:  The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. There
     is a left-sided pacemaker with right atrial, right ventricular and coronary
     sinus leads.
     
     There are no central or segmental filling defects within the pulmonary
     arteries.  The heart demonstrates multi-chamber enlargements.  There is
     calcification of the native coronary arteries as well as of the aortic valve.
     The thoracic aorta demonstrates atherosclerotic change of the arch and
     descending portions without aneurysmal dilation.  There are small bilateral
     pleural effusions.  No regions of consolidation are identified.  There is
     lower lobe atelectasis.  Multiple punctate calcifications are seen within the
     lungs.
     
     There is prevascular, paratracheal, and subcarinal lymphadenopathy, which is
     stable.  The largest node in the paratracheal region measures 1.8 cm.
     
     The contrast has refluxed into the hepatic veins consistent with right heart
     failure and/or tricuspid regurgitation.  The visualized organs of the upper
     abdomen appear unremarkable.  There is a small simple fluid attenuating cyst
     in the region of the pancreatic tail, which cannot be further characterized.
     
     There is multilevel degenerative change of the thoracic spine.  There is a
     hemangioma in the T9 vertebral body, stable.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  No evidence of central or segmental pulmonary embolism.
     2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
     3.  Mediastinal lymphadenopathy, stable since the prior study.
     4.  Cardiomegaly with reflux of contrast into the hepatic veins consistent
     with right heart failure.
     5.  Small cyst in the region of the pancreatic tail, incompletely
     characterized.

     HISTORY:  Dyspnea on exertion.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3065-3-17**].
     
     FINDINGS:  The patient was imaged in a lordotic position.  Respiratory motion
     limits the examination further.  Grossly, there is no focal consolidation.
     There is subtle increased opacity in the retrocardiac region which may be due
     to underlying atelectasis.  However, an early developing pneumonia cannot be
     entirely excluded.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is
     evidence of prior CABG and an indwelling biventricular AICD/pacemaker.  A
     right upper extremity PICC line is incidentally noted although the distal tip
     is not well visualized secondary to limiting factors.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Markedly limited study.  Left lower lobe atelectasis likely
     although an early developing pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.  If
     clinically feasible, consider further evaluation with PA and lateral view.

     INDICATION:  76-year-old man with dyspnea on exertion.  Recent ultrasound
     demonstrating left upper extremity thrombosis.  Evaluate for pulmonary
     embolism.
     
     COMPARISON:  Left upper extremity ultrasound from [**3065-3-23**] and CTA of the
     chest from [**3065-3-17**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT scanning of the chest was performed before and
     after intravenous contrast.  Multiplanar reformations were obtained.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST:  No central or segmental filling defects are identified
     within the pulmonary arteries.  The superior vena cava filled with contrast.
     The subclavian and internal jugular veins are not visualized.  There are
     multiple right-sided collateral vessels in the chest wall seen, which may be
     related to fast injection.
     
     There is a left-sided pacemaker and defibrillator with leads in the coronary
     sinus, right atrium, and right ventricle.  There is stable marked
     cardiomegaly.  Contrast has not yet reached the aorta, but its outline is
     normal.  Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Since the prior
     study, the bilateral pleural effusions have increased in size.  There is
     associated lower lobe atelectasis.  Calcified pulmonary nodules are unchanged.
     The central airways are patent.
     
     A right-sided PICC is seen extending into the superior vena cava.
     
     In the visualized upper abdomen extensive calcification of the splenic artery
     and SMA are seen.
     
     OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  There are degenerative changes of the spine, but no
     concerning lytic or sclerotic lesions.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  No central or segmental pulmonary embolism.
     2.  Opacified superior vena cava.  The upper extremity veins seen on
     ultrasound are not imaged on this study.
     3.  Increase in the bilateral moderate sized pleural effusions.
