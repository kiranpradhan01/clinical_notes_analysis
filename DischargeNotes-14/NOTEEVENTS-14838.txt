     INDICATION: 54 year old woman with a history of malignant phyllodes tumor,
     presenting with constipation and anemia.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Axial images from the lung apices to the pubic symphysis were
     obtained following the administration of oral contrast and 150 cc Optiray.
     Optiray was used secondary to the patient's history of allergies.
     
     COMPARISON: [**2960-1-8**]
     
     CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST: There is a large mass in the left upper lobe measuring
     5 x 10 x 6.5 cm.  There is precarinal lymph node measuring 13 mm. Previously
     seen pulmonary nodules in the posterior right lower lobe and left lower lobe
     are stable in appearance.  No pleural effusions are identified.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: The spleen, gallbladder, pancreas, and adrenal
     glands are normal in appearance.  There are multiple low attenuation masses
     present in the liver, given, the patient history these likely represent
     metastases.  There is a small cyst in the right kidney, present on the prior
     exam.  The left kidney has normal appearance.  There is no retroperitoneal
     lymphadenopathy identified.  No free fluid is seen. The opacified loops of
     small and large bowel are unremarkable.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: The distal ureters and bladder are unremarkable. The
     uterus is enlarged and appears distorted by what appears to be fibroids.  No
     pelvic inguinal lymph adenopathy identified. No free fluid.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  The osseous structures are unremarkable.
     
     These findings were conveyed to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12834**] covering for Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12835**], the
     patient's primary care physician.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     MRI OF THE LUMBAR SPINE:
     
     CLINICAL INFORMATION:   Patient with phylloides tumor of the left breast and
     severe back pain and anemia for further evaluation.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  T1 and T2 sagittal and T2 axial images of the lumbar spine were
     obtained.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is diffuse decreased signal within the visualized vertebral
     bodies indicative of marrow hyperplasia or infiltrative process.  In addition,
     the left pedicle of T12 demontrates expansion and soft tissue mass which
     extends to the superior aspect of the left neural foramen at T12-L1 level.
     Additionally foci of increased signal on T2 weighted images are seen within
     the anterior portions of L1, L3 and L4 vertebrae.  These findings are strongly
     suspicious for metastatic disease.  There is narrowing of the superior portion
     of neural foramen by soft tissue mass at T12-L1 level.  No evidence of
     epidural mass is seen nor is there evidence of compression of the distal
     spinal cord or cauda equina.
     
     The L3-4 to L5-S1 discs demonstrate degenerative signal.  There is mild disc
     bulge at L3-4 level.  Small central disc protrusion indenting the thecal sac
     is seen at L4-5 level.  There is also small disc protrusion at L5-S1 level in
     the midline indenting the thecal sac.  There is no evidence of nerve root
     displacement seen in the lower lumbar region.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Diffuse marrow signal abnormalities indicative of marrow
     hyperplasia or infiltrative process.  Expansion with soft tissue involvement
     in relation with the left pedicle of T12 with extension to the superior aspect
     of the left T12-L1 neural foramen.  Focal signal abnormalities involving L1,
     L3 and L4 vertebrae consistent with metastatic disease.  Further evaluation
     with gadolinium enhanced MRI of the entire spinal canal is recommended.
     Degenerative changes in the lower lumbar region as above.  Findings were E-
     mailed to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1810**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at the time of interpretation of this study on
     [**2962-2-7**] at 2:00 pm.

     AP PORTABLE CHEST:
     
     INDICATION: 54 y/o female with progressive hypoxia.
     
     There is no prior study for comparison. Correlation is made to recent CT
     examinations.
     
     FINDINGS: There is an ill defined parenchymal mass with irregular borders
     located anterior and medial within the left upper lung field, obscuring the
     left upper mediastinal and cardiac borders. Within the left upper lobe, there
     is associated radiodensities consistent with consolidation and/or collapse. In
     addition, bilateral diffuse interstitial densities noted. The heart is normal
     in size. There are no pleural effusions. Soft tissue and osseous structures
     are unremarkable. The pulmonary vasculature is normal.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) Left upper lobe lung mass with associated consolidation and/or collapse.
     2) Bilateral increased interstitial densities. Possibilities include lymphatic
     obstruction, fluid overload, or atypical heart failure. Lymphangitic spread is
     unlikely due to the short time course of these findings. Continued follow up
     is recommended.

     FINDINGS:  This is a very limited examination due to patient discomfort.  In
     the provided sagittal T2-weighted images, there are no foci of abnormal signal
     intensity within the vertebral bodies or spinal cord to suggest metastatic
     disease.  The cord is of normal signal intensity throughout.

     CT ANGIOGRAM OF THE CHEST:  This exam is limited by patient breathing
     artifact.  Given that limitation however, there is no sign of filling defect
     to suggest intraluminal clot.  There is a large left upper lobe lung mass, not
     substantially changed since the previous chest CT of [**2962-2-5**].  This surrounds
     the left pulmonary artery, almost completely compressing it.  There are small
     bilateral pleural effusions.  There are new, patchy bilateral and peripheral
     predominantly upper lung zone opacities.  Given the time-course of
     development, these probably represent asymmetric pulmonary edema rather than
     an infectious process.   Mediastinal lymphadenopathy is unchanged.  These
     findings were paged to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 12841**] [**Name (STitle) **] at the time of the exam.

     FINDINGS:  A single frontal view of the chest with comparison to [**2962-2-10**].
     There has been interval increased collapse resulting in complete opacification
     of the left hemithorax.  This is consistent with complete lobar collapse.
     There is truncation of the left main stem bronchus with shift of the trachea
     to the left.  There are patchy areas of opacification primarily located in a
     right perihilar and right infrahilar location.  This may represent an element
     of pulmonary edema.

     Shortness of breath.
     
     AP CHEST, ONE VIEW: Comparison [**2962-2-11**]. Since the prior exam, there has been
     significant improved aeration of the left lung. There is a large 8 to 9 cm
     soft tissue density in the left AP window/hilar region. This presumably
     represents known lung CA. There are extensive interstitial and alveolar
     opacities throughout the right lung, significantly increased from the prior
     exam. There are no large pleural effusions. Findings likely represent a
     symmetric edema. Followup films after diuresis could be performed to exclude
     underlying infection.

Admit Note:

See full admit nursing note for additional details.

Pt admitted [**2962-2-8**] after a bronch that occulded bronchus with clots.
Pt with metastatic cancer lung,bone,liver.  Second bronch was completed to remove previous clots.  Large tumor emeshed in bronchus.
Did well and sent to [**Location 6560**] service.  Received one cycle of chemo and on [**2962-2-15**] pt developed left sided abd/rib pain and progressively became SOB with decrease sats and fatigue.  Transfer to MICU for BIPAP and ? intubation if needed.  
Arrives awake but lethargic.  Oriented to room.  100% NRB in place with sats in the mid 90's but quickly desats when O2 removed to 70's.
ABG done-adequate acid/base status at this time. Speaking in 3-4 word sentences only. Trachae midline.  No crepitus palpated. Foley cath inserted-pt received 20 mg lasix IV on the floor prior to arrival.
See CareVue for detailed objective data.  
+ excerbation of herpes on buttocks.  Zovirax cream to affected area.  + pain.  Medicated with MSO4 IV with good effect.
NPO except for ice chips.  + BS.  Strong peripheral pulses.
+air mattress.

Plan:  Assess respiratory status-BIPAP and intubate if pt becomes increasingly fatigued. I spoke to her about the possibility of being intubated and she consents and offered no questions when asked.
Pain control:  ? if pt needs PCA pump to alleviate pain and improve respiratory status.  Emotional support to pt and family.

     Compared to [**2962-2-25**].
     
     INDICATION:  Small cell lung cancer.  Worsening shortness of breath.
     
     There has been marked interval increase in opacification of the left upper
     lobe as compared to the previous study.  On the lateral view, the left upper
     lobe and lingula are nearly completely consolidated, likely due to post-
     obstructive pneumonitis.  Note is also made of some new consolidation within
     the left lower lobe.  The extensive consolidation in the left upper lobe
     obscures the underlying known central lung mass.
     
     Note is also made of small bilateral pleural effusions and a diffuse
     interstitial pattern in the right lung.
     
     The left-sided cardiac and mediastinal structures cannot be assessed due to
     obscuration.  There is fullness of the right hilum, likely on the basis of
     vascular distention.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Extensive post-obstructive pneumonia in the left upper lobe and lingula,
     likely secondary to known centrally obstructing lung mass.  The mass is
     obscured by the superimposed acute process.
     2.  New left lower lobe consolidation, also likely reflecting a site of
     pneumonia.
     3.  Interval development of congestive heart failure pattern with interstitial
     edema.
     4.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.

     PA AND LATERAL CHEST: Comparison is  made to prior PA and lateral chest dated
     [**2962-3-2**].  There is still opacification of the left upper lobe.  There is now
     some elevation of the left hemidiaphragm raising the question of some
     atelectasis of the left upper lobe.
     
     IMPRESSION: The left hemidiaphragm appears slightly elevated raising the
     concern of some atelectasis.

     INDICATION: Left lung cancer with pleuritic chest pain, rule out PE.
     
     COMPARISON: [**2962-3-3**].
     
     TECHNIQUE: Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     lung bases to the lung apices after the administration of 100 cc of
     intravenous Optiray due to the fast bolus rate required for this study.
     Multiplanar reformatted images were obtained.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST: No pulmonary embolism is identified. There has
     been interval reduction in the size of a left pleural effusion which is now
     small in size. The previous right pleural effusion is no longer present. There
     is no pericardial effusion. Again there is a large left hilar mass that
     encases and obstructs the left upper lobe bronchus, extemds to and indents the
     left main pulmonary artery and  encases pulmonary artery branches extending
     into the left upper lobe. There is associated consolidation/collapse of the
      of the left upper lobe with persistent aeration of the lingula.It is
     difficult to clearly distinguish boundry of tumor and collapsed lung. There is
     a subcarinal mass as previously demonstrated
     On lung windows there  has been virtually complete resolution of the
     scattered ground glass densities in the right lung with focal subpleural
     illdefined densities bilaterally. A nodular density located medially in the
     right lower lobe adjacent to the spine which measures 8 mm. is difficult to
     see on the prior study, possibly due to the previous effusion. A more focal
     opacity is noted in the left lingula as well as the peripheral subpleural
     opacities in the left lower lobe Atelectasis/scar in right middle lobe .
     
     BONE WINDOWS: There is a sclerotic focus within a lower thoracic vertebral
     body as seen on the prior study suspicious for metastatic disease.
     
     Multiplanar reformatted images support the above findings.

     COMPARISON: [**2962-3-6**]
     
     FINDINGS: The cardiac and mediastinal contours appear stable. The pulmonary
     vasculature is not engorged. Once again, there is opacification of the left
     upper  zone, less extensive than on prior study but this is likely due to
     increased collapse of the left upper lobe secondary to the central mass. No
     acute infiltrates, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion are identified.

     COMPARISON:  [**2962-2-5**].
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  In the interval, there has been a marked
     decrease in size of the previously evident left hilar mass.  In January of
     this year, this lesion measured 5.6 x 10.9 cm.  Currently, it measures 4.1 x
     4.4 cm.  In addition, there was a previously evident subcarinal mass measuring
     3.0 x 2.3 cm, which is no longer evident.  There is persistent narrowing of
     the left upper lobe bronchus, but less so as compared to the prior exam.
     There has been interval re-expansion of the left upper lobe with only slight
     residual atelectatic changes.  The previously evident well defined posterior
     right lower lobe appears less distinct and has dramatically decreased in size.
      The previously described posterior left lower lobe nodule is also smaller and
     less distinct.  Atelectatic changes are present within the right middle lobe
     adjacent to the heart.  There are no new nodules within the lung parenchyma.
     Several nonpathologically enlarged pretracheal lymph nodes are present, as
     well as a small carinal lymph node measuring approximately 5 mm.  There is
     otherwise no significant axillary or mediastinal adenopathy.  There are no
     pleural or pericardial effusions.  The heart and great vessels appear normal.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:
     
     The previously apparent liver metastases are smaller and less distinct in the
     interval.  There is a 1.0 x 1.1 cm ill defined low attenuation lesion within
     the left lobe of the liver adjacent to the porta hepatis.  This was
     demonstrated on the previous examination.  There is an additional low
     attenuation focus within the right lobe of the liver posteriorly.  Several
     tiny low attenuation foci are present.  However, overall these lesions are
     smaller and less evident and several of them are no longer seen.  The
     gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, kidneys, and adrenal glands appear grossly
     normal.  The right kidney again demonstrates a low attenuation focus
     consistent with a cyst.  The opacified loops of small and large bowel are
     unremarkable.  There is no significant mesenteric or retoperitoneal
     adenopathy.  There are no fluid collections present within the abdomen.

     There has been interval re-expansion of the left upper lobe with only slight
     residual atelectatic changes.  The previously evident well defined posterior
     right lower lobe appears less distinct and has dramatically decreased in size.
      The previously described posterior left lower lobe nodule is also smaller and
     less distinct.  Atelectatic changes are present within the right middle lobe
     adjacent to the heart.  There are no new nodules within the lung parenchyma.
     Several nonpathologically enlarged pretracheal lymph nodes are present, as
     well as a small carinal lymph node measuring approximately 5 mm.  There is
     otherwise no significant axillary or mediastinal adenopathy.  There are no
     pleural or pericardial effusions.  The heart and great vessels appear normal.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:
     
     The previously apparent liver metastases are smaller and less distinct in the
     interval.  There is a 1.0 x 1.1 cm ill defined low attenuation lesion within
     the left lobe of the liver adjacent to the porta hepatis.  This was
     demonstrated on the previous examination.  There is an additional low
     attenuation focus within the right lobe of the liver posteriorly.  Several
     tiny low attenuation foci are present.  However, overall these lesions are
     smaller and less evident and several of them are no longer seen.  The
     gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, kidneys, and adrenal glands appear grossly
     normal.  The right kidney again demonstrates a low attenuation focus
     consistent with a cyst.  The opacified loops of small and large bowel are
     unremarkable.  There is no significant mesenteric or retoperitoneal
     adenopathy.  There are no fluid collections present within the abdomen.

     MRI OF THE CERVICAL SPINE WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST, [**2962-6-3**]
     
     CLINICAL HISTORY:  Metastatic small cell lung carcinoma and upper extremity
     weakness.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Sagittal T1-weigfhted, T2-weighted and STIR images, axial gradient
     echo images and post-contrast sagittal T1-weighted images were obtained.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     Comparison is made to the [**2961-2-8**] study which consisted only of sagittal T2-
     weighted images.  On the current study, on the T2-weighted images, the marrow
     signal intensity is very heterogeneous and there are multiple areas of T2
     hyperintensity most consistent with metastatic disease, essentially new since
     the prior study.  There is corresponding STIR hyperintensity, T1 hypointensity
     and irregular enhancement.  There is also contiguous epidural and paraspinal
     enhancement.  No focal epidural mass is seen to affect the spinal cord.  The
     foramina are not evaluated on the post-contrast sagittal images.
     
     Allowing for motion artifact, the spinal cord is of normal size.  It is best
     evaluated on the axial gradient echo images where it appears to be normal in
     signal intensity.  There is some spondylosis with a prominent disc/osteophyte
     complex on the left at C5/6 which indents the spinal cord.  It is unchanged
     from the prior sagittal study.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  There is diffuse bony metastatic disease without evidence of a compression
     fracture or focal epidural mass.  The sagittal post-contrast images show
     diffuse enhancement around the vertebral bodies including epidural
     enhancement.  Some of this may be related to enlarged vessels.  There is no
     mass effect on the spinal cord.  The foramina are not evaluated.
     2.  There is a moderate-sized left-sided disc/osteophyte complex at C5/6 which
     indents the spinal cord, as suggested on the prior study.

     MRI OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST ON [**6-3**].
     
     CLINICAL HISTORY:  Small-cell lung carcinoma with liver and bone metastases.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar pre and post contrast T1-weighted images, axial T2-
     weighted, susceptibility and FLAIR images were obtained.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     There is no evidence of an intracranial mass or abnormal enhancement to
     suggest a brain metastasis.  Flow artifact projects over the medial left
     frontal lobe on the axial post-contrast images without evidence of a lesion on
     the other post contrast images.  There is slight T2 hyperintensity near the
     lateral ventricles likely related to small vessel disease.  The ventricles and
     sulci are normal in size.
     
     The calvarial marrow is quite heterogeneous and overall T1-hypintense with
     areas of enhancement most consistent with diffuse metastatic disease.  Similar
     abnormalities are seen on the cervical spine.  There is an air-fluid level in
     the left sphenoid sinus, new since the CT of [**2962-2-8**].
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) There is no evidence of a brain metastasis.
     
     2) Calvarial marrow is diffusely abnormal consistent with an infiltrative
     process such as metastatic disease.
     
     3) There is an air-fluid level in the sphenoid sinus.

     HISTORY:  Small cell lung cancer.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired axial images are obtained from the thoracic
     inlet to the pubic symphysis after administration of 150cc Optiray. Non-ionic
     intravenous contrast was used secondary to the patient's history of allergies.
     
     Comparison: Prior CT report of [**2962-5-3**].
     
     CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  The heart and great vessels appear unremarkable.
     There is a stable appearance of previously described left hilar mass,
     measuring 4.4 x 4.2 cm, not significantly changed from the prior measurement
     of 4.1 x 4.4 cm. There is persistent narrowing of the left upper lobe
     bronchus. There is interval increase in the pericardial lymph node, currently
     measuring 2.2 x 1.3 cm. Also noted is a small left-sided pleural effusion.
     There is slight increase in the atelectasis in the left upper lobe. Also noted
     is slight interval increase in size of previously described posterior left
     lower lobe nodule. Again noted is minimal atelectasis present within the right
     middle lobe. There is no new pulmonary nodule or mass identified. There are
     several small pretracheal lymph nodes identified, which do not meet the CT
     criteria of pathologic enlargement. There is no pericardial effusion. The
     airway is patent to the level of segmental bronchi.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There is interval development of
     numerous hepatic low attenuation lesions, the largest of which measures 2.1 x
     1.9 cm and is located in the right lobe of the liver. The other findings are
     highly worrisome for metastatic disease. The gallbladder, spleen, pancreas,
     kidneys and adrenal glands appear grossly unremarkable. There is no a small
     amount of a cystic low attenuation lesion in the mid-pole of the right kidney,
     most likely representing a small renal cyst. The above finding remains
     unchanged from the prior exam. There is interval development of multiple
     mildly enlarged lymph nodes around the celiac axis, and in the region of the
     porta hepatis. Visualized small and large bowel loops appear unremarkable.
     There is no free air or free fluid within the abdomen.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The distal ureters, urinary bladder and rectum
     appear unremarkable. There is no significant pelvic lymph adenopathy or pelvic
     free fluid.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      54 year old woman with h/o breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer with 
      metastases to the cervical and lumbar spines.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      evaluate for extent of malignancy, metastases                                   
     No contraindications for IV contrast
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Small cell lung cancer.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired axial images are obtained from the thoracic
     inlet to the pubic symphysis after administration of 150cc Optiray. Non-ionic
     intravenous contrast was used secondary to the patient's history of allergies.
     
     Comparison: Prior CT report of [**2962-5-3**].
     
     CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  The heart and great vessels appear unremarkable.
     There is a stable appearance of previously described left hilar mass,
     measuring 4.4 x 4.2 cm, not significantly changed from the prior measurement
     of 4.1 x 4.4 cm. There is persistent narrowing of the left upper lobe
     bronchus. There is interval increase in the pericardial lymph node, currently
     measuring 2.2 x 1.3 cm. Also noted is a small left-sided pleural effusion.
     There is slight increase in the atelectasis in the left upper lobe. Also noted
     is slight interval increase in size of previously described posterior left
     lower lobe nodule. Again noted is minimal atelectasis present within the right
     middle lobe. There is no new pulmonary nodule or mass identified. There are
     several small pretracheal lymph nodes identified, which do not meet the CT
     criteria of pathologic enlargement. There is no pericardial effusion. The
     airway is patent to the level of segmental bronchi.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There is interval development of
     numerous hepatic low attenuation lesions, the largest of which measures 2.1 x
     1.9 cm and is located in the right lobe of the liver. The other findings are
     highly worrisome for metastatic disease. The gallbladder, spleen, pancreas,
     kidneys and adrenal glands appear grossly unremarkable. There is no a small
     amount of a cystic low attenuation lesion in the mid-pole of the right kidney,
     most likely representing a small renal cyst. The above finding remains
     unchanged from the prior exam. There is interval development of multiple
     mildly enlarged lymph nodes around the celiac axis, and in the region of the
     porta hepatis. Visualized small and large bowel loops appear unremarkable.
     There is no free air or free fluid within the abdomen.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The distal ureters, urinary bladder and rectum
     appear unremarkable. There is no significant pelvic lymph adenopathy or pelvic
     free fluid.
     
     Bone windows again demonstrates a heterogeneous pattern to the bones and
                                                                 (Over)

     contains several lucencies within several lumbar vertebral bodies, grossly
     unchanged from the prior exam.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) There is interval development of numerous low attenuation liver lesions,
     highly suspicious for metastatic disease.
     2) Interval development of lymph adenopathy along the celiac axis, porta
     hepatis, and the pericardial region.
     3) Stable appearance of left hilar mass, currently measuring 4.4 x 4.2 cm and
     compressing the right upper lobe bronchus.
     4) Heterogeneous pattern of the lumbar spine and the bilateral iliacs, which
     could represent a mixed lytic and sclerotic phase, concerning for metastatic
     disease.
