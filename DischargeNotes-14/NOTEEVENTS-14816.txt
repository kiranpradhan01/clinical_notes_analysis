                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  77-year-old man pedestrian struck by high-speed motor vehicle.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector axial images of the chest, abdomen and pelvis were
     obtained with 130 mL Optiray intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal
     reformatted images were obtained.
     
     CT CHEST:  The heart size is normal.  Aortic calcifications are noted.  There
     is no evidence of acute injury.  The pulmonary arteries are patent.  There is
     no axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy.  Cystic lesions are noted
     at the lung bases in areas of consolidation. There is no evidence of
     pneumothorax.  No pleural or pericardial effusion is identified.
     
     CT ABDOMEN:  The liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, stomach, and bowel
     loops are within normal limits.  There is decreased enhancement of the right
     renal artery and there is surrounding stranding.  In addition, there is
     infarction of the upper pole of the right kidney. Stranding is identified
     around the right renal artery and extending inferiorly in the retroperitoneum.
     The left kidney enhances normally.  There are bilateral parapelvic cysts.  Low
     attenuation cortical foci may represent cysts but are too small to be fully
     characterized.  There is a small amount of perihepatic fluid.  There is
     relatively decreased enhancement of the right adrenal gland.
     
     CT PELVIS:  Foley catheter and air are noted in the bladder.  The prostate is
     enlarged.  The seminal vesicles, sigmoid colon, and rectum are unremarkable.
     There is no free fluid and no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There is an oblique fracture through the T10 vertebral body,
     which extends posteriorly through the right pedicle.  A small adjacent
     avulsion fragment is seen arising from the lateral superior endplate of T11.
     There also right L2, L3, and L4 and left L5 transverse process fractures.
     There are left 5-9th rib fractures laterally and right 4th and 5th anterior
     and 12th posterior rib fractures.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Traumatic right renal artery dissection with infarction of the upper pole

     HISTORY:  77-year-old man pedestrian struck by high-speed motor vehicle.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector axial images of the cervical spine were obtained
     without contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were obtained.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is a prominent Schmorl's node of the superior endplate of C7.
     A small is seen arising from the anterior superior endplate of C7. No other
     fractures are identified.  There is no prevertebral soft tissue swelling.  The
     visualized outline of the thecal sac is unremarkable.  A small cystic focus is
     noted in the C2 vertebral body. Dependent atelectasis is noted.
     
     IMPRESSION: No definite C-spine fracture noted.  The small fragment off C7 is
     likely degenerative in nature, or may indicate a small fractured osteophyte.
     The visualized outline of the thecal sac is unremarkable, however MRI would be
     more sensitive for the detection of spinal canal pathology.

     HISTORY:  77-year-old man pedestrian struck by high speed motor vehicle.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage.  A more rounded focus of
     right frontal hemorrhage may be intraparenchymal or subarachnoid.  Hypodensity
     in the frontal lobes is not significantly changed from the patient's prior
     examinations.  The patient is status post prior left-sided craniotomy.  There
     is a fracture of the left frontal bone at the craniotomy margin with lateral
     displacement of the posterior component by the width of the disploic space.
     Multiple surgical clips are identified and there is encephalomalacia of the
     anterior left temporal lobe. There is no hydrocephalus or shift of normally
     midline structures.  There is a small amount of high density fluid in the
     paranasal sinuses consistent with blood. There is opacification of the left
     middle ear and partial opacification of the mastoid air cells. No definite
     temporal bone fracture is seen, but this exam is limited for such an
     evaluation.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage. Likely bifrontal contusions.  No
     significant mass effect or shift of normally midline structures.  Left frontal
     fracture at the site of prior craniotomy.  Opacification of the left middle
     ear and mastoid air cells raises concern for occult temporal bone fracture.
     Dedicated temporal bone CT is recommended.

     CHEST AP:  Artifact from underlying backboard limits the evaluation.  There is
     mild cardiomegaly. Prominence of the mediastinal contours and upper zone
     pulmonary vasculature is likely related to supine technique. There is lower
     lobe atelectasis.  The lungs are otherwise clear. There is no evidence of
     pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Endotracheal tube appears in satisfactory

IMAGING~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CT head: Diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage.  More rounded focus of
right frontal hemorrhage may be intraparenchymal orsubarachnoid. 

No significant mass effect or shift of normally midline
structures. 
CT trunk: 
1.  Traumatic right renal artery flow limiting dissection with
infarction of 
the upper pole of the right kidney. 
2.  Oblique T10 vertebral body fracture which extends to the
right pedicle.  
Adjacent small avulsion fracture of T11. 
3.  Right L2, L3, L4, and left L5 transverse process fractures.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the TSICU following assessment and 
resuscitation in the trauma bay.  Neurosurgery, vascular 
surgery, and orthopedics were consulted initially based on the 
patients injuries diagnosed on imaging.  Vascular surgery 
recommended expectant management for the renal artery disruption 
given inability to anticoagulate patient due to his head injury. 
 The patient was loaded with dilantin and maintained on this 
throughout his hospital course.  A repeat head CT was performed 
at 12hours which revealed worsening subarachnoid hemorrhage.  A 
bolt was then placed by neurosurgery for ICP monitoring and 
mannitol begun.  A CTA head was performed which was negative for 
an aneurysm.  A feeding tube was placed and tube feeds were 
initiated.  The patient was stable throughout the course of the 
next two days and the bolt was removed on [**6-6**].  A repeat head 
CT on [**6-7**] revealed evolving infarct and stable SAH.   He was 
extubated on [**6-9**] able to breath and protect his airway.  His 
mental status remained depressed in that he was opening his eyes 
spontaneously and minimally reactive to his environment but was 
not verbal and unable to follow commands.  He was stable in the 
ICU for another day and was transferred to the neuro stepdown 
unit on [**6-10**].  On [**6-11**] he was noted to be progressively tachypneic 
with an intermittently agonal respiratory pattern.  He was also 
noted to be less interactive with family and care givers.  A 
family meeting was held an DNR/DNI status was confirmed.  A 
pallative care consult was initiated.  The decision to make the 
patient comfort care measures only was made by the patients 
family after long discussions regarding the patient's prior 
wishes.  Care was withdrawn at this point and the patient 
expired on [**3378-6-14**] with his family at the bedside.

      appearance of extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage and parenchymal contusions.
      CTA axial images demonstrate no evidence for large underlying aneursym or
      transection of major cranial vessels though reformatted and 3-D images are
      necessary for more sensitive evaluation.  The patient now has a new pressure
      monitoring bolt in the right frontal region.  Scalp hemorrhage/edema and blood

     REASON FOR EXAM:  77-year-old male, status post trauma, with diffuse
     subarachnoid hemorrhage that has increased in size significantly.  Evaluate
     for aneurysm.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Head CTA with initial 5-mm axial non-contrast images and
     subsequently re-imaging at 1.25 mm axial intervals according to departmental
     protocol with 80 cc of Optiray as intravenous contrast [**Doctor Last Name 116**].  Reformatted
     images in the sagittal, coronal, and oblique planes as well as volume rendered
     images obtained.
     
     Compared to CTA of [**3376-4-4**] CT and the most recent head CT from the same day
     done 13 hours earlier.
     
     FINDINGS:  Initial non-contrast images demonstrate no significant change in
     extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage surrounding both cerebral convexities,
     parafalcine subdural hemorrhage, or right convexity subdural hematoma as
     compared to 13 hours earlier.  There is no shift of midline structures,
     hydrocephalus, or change in ventricular size. Right frontal intracranial
     pressure monitor is now in place.  Encephalomalacia in the left temporal
     region, a surgical clip in the region of the left supraclinoid ICA, and the
     left temporoparietal craniotomy changes are stable.  Also unchanged is a large
     left convexity subgaleal hematoma and subcutaneous hemorrhage in the left
     infratemporal region.  As before, a high-density fluid/air level is seen in
     bilateral sphenoid and left maxillary sinus. Orogastric and endotracheal tubes
     are in place.
     
     Post-contrast images demonstrate no definite aneurysm or vascular
     malformation.  Mild atherosclerosis is seen in bilateral internal carotid,
                                                                 (Over)

     HISTORY:  77-year-old man pedestrian struck with diffuse subarachnoid
     hemorrhage.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3378-6-3**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is a profound increase in the volume of diffuse subarachnoid
     hemorrhage.  There is an increase in the parafalcine subdural hematomas since
     [**6-3**]. The right-sided convexity subdural hematoma appears larger than on the
     prior study. The increase in subarachnoid hemorrhage is beyond that expected
     from trauma alone, and raises a question of an underlying vascular lesion. It
     may be advisable to investigate the possibility of an aneurysm.
     
     There may be diffuse hypodensity of the brain, perhaps suggesting global
     hypoxia.
     
     Blood is seen pooling in the malacic left temporal area. Ventricular size is
     stable and there is no shift of normally midline structures.  The left
     subgaleal hematoma has also significantly increased in size.  A small amount
     of blood is again noted in the paranasal sinuses.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Profound increase in amount of diffuse subarachnoid blood and
     increase in size of the right subdural hematoma. These findings were discussed
     with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4341**] at 4:25 a.m. on [**3378-6-4**].
     
     The extent of subarachnoid blood raises a concern of an underlying vascular
     lesion. There is a concern of diffuse brain hypodensity.
     
     Increased subgaleal blood.

     Comparison is made to prior chest radiograph dated [**3378-6-4**].
     
     SEMIERECT PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:
     
     FINDINGS:  
     
     There is slightly increased linear atelectasis is noted within the left lower
     lung field with increased obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm likely
     representing increased basilar atelectasis with early infiltrate not
     completely excluded.  Remaining lungs appear clear, and low lung volumes
     persist.  There is unchanged appearance to over distention of the endotracheal
     tube balloon cuff which is approximately 4 cm from the carina.  Swan-Ganz
     catheter tip lies within the right main pulmonary artery and nasogastric tube
     remains within the stomach.  No evidence of pneumothorax, pulmonary edema, or
     large effusions.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Increased left lower lobe linear atelectasis with hazy opacity noted
     within the left lower lobe obscuring left hemidiaphragm, also likely 
     atelectasis; however, an early infiltrate in this region cannot be excluded
     and continued radiographic followup is recommended.
     
     2.  Unchanged appearance to over distended endotracheal tube balloon cuff.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      77 year old man with known diffuse SAH                                          
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      ?interval change                                                                
     No contraindications for IV contrast
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
     INDICATION:  Known diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3378-6-4**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is a new area of wedge-shaped hypodensity in the
     left posterior temporal lobe that most suggests an evolving infarction. This
     has arisen too late to favor a slowly progressing contusion. There is similar,
     but less impressive, hypodensity in the right posterior temporal lobe. This
     pair of findings suggests thrombosis, dissection, or spasm of the distal
     basilar artery.
     
     Subarachnoid hemorrhage is slightly improved while frontal contusions
     demonstrate far greater edema. There is slightly more blood layering within
     area of left temporal encephalomalacia. There is no new mass effect or shift
     of normally midline structures. Appearance of the ventricles and cisterns is
     stable.  The large left convexity subgaleal hematoma and subcutaneous
     hemorrhage in the left infratemporal region is improving.  High density
     presumed blood layering in the sphenoid and left maxillary sinus is unchanged.
     ETT and NG tube are in place.  The patient is status post left temporoparietal
     craniectomy with a surgical clip in the region of the supraclinoid ICA.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  New left and probable right temporal lesions most suggestive of evolving
     infarction.
     
     2. Great increasee in the volume of edema associated with the
     bifrontal contusions.
     
     3. No increae in subarachnoid hemorrhage.
     
     4. Improving large left subgaleal hematoma.
     
     
     
                                                                 (Over)

     COMPARISON:  [**3378-6-4**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast axial CT imaging of the abdomen with coronal and
     sagittal reformats was reviewed.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST:  There are small bibasilar pleural effusions with
     associated bibasilar atelectasis.  Central line tip terminates at the
     cavoatrial junction.  NG tube is in the stomach.  The liver, pancreas, spleen,
     small bowel loops are unchanged.  Adrenal glands are stable.  The gallbladder
     is distended, and contains high density material, either sludge or prior
     contrast, but there is no pericholecystic fluid or evidence for acute
     cholecystitis. The kidneys are unchanged without perinephric hematoma, though
     renal perfusion cannot be assessed on this non- contrast study.  There is no
     evidence for hemorrhage in the abdomen or pelvis.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  Foley is present in the bladder.  Prostate is
     unchanged.  The rectum, sigmoid, large bowel, and right fat-containing
     inguinal hernia are unchanged.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  Multiple fractures including T10 vertebral body oblique, T11
     avulsion, and L2, L3, L4 and left L5 transverse process, are all unchanged,
     not all rib fractures are again identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  No evidence for hemorrhage in the abdomen or pelvis.
     2.  Bilateral pleural effusions and associated atelectasis.
     3.  Unchanged appearance of multiple fractures.

     Examination is limited due to supine technique and marked patient rotation;

     There is no evidence of new parenchymal infiltrates, large effusions,
     pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema.  There is slightly increased atelectasis
     involving the basilar left lower lobe.  There has been interval removal of
     right-sided central venous line, and Dobbhoff feeding tube terminates within
     the distal antrum or proximal duodenum.

     INDICATION:  77-year-old man with poor mental status.  Evaluate for interval
     change.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3378-6-7**], head CT.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast CT of the head.
     
     FINDINGS:  There has been little interval change in the previously seen
     hypodensity in the left posterotemporal lobe suggestive of an evolving
     infarction.  The previously seen right posterotemporal lobe hypodensity is
     difficult to appreciate on today's study.
     
     The subarachnoid hemorrhage in frontal lobes and occipital lobes and frontal
     contusion are stable in appearance.  The blood layering within the left
     temporal encephalomalacia is similar in extent.  There is a new 2.0 x 1.0 cm
     hyperdensity within the posteroinferior left temporal lobe, just posterior to
     the blood layering in the area of encephalomalacia in the left anterior
     temporal lobe region.  It is consistent with an intraparenchymal hemorrhage
     that appears new compared to prior study from [**3378-6-7**].  There is a very
     small amount of surrounding edema.  However, there is no mass effect or shift
     of the midline.
     
     The patient is status post left temporoparietal craniotomy.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  New left intraparenchymal hemorrhage measuring 2.0 x 1.0 cm in the
     posterior left temporal lobe.
     
     2.  Otherwise unchanged head CT.
     
     3.  No evidence of midline shift.
