      r/o asp. pneumonia

     INDICATION: Shortness of breath.
     
     COMPARISON: None
     
     CHEST, PORTABLE: The view is apical lordotic. The heart size is normal. There
     is increased opacity in the retrocardiac region on the left. There is
     silhouetting of the left hemidiaphragm.  There is asymmetric prominence of the
     interstitium in the right lung, which may be due to patient rotation. The
     aorta is calcified and tortuous.  No pneumothorax.
     
     IMPRESSION: Left base consolidation.  Prominence of the vasculature on the
     right as compared with the left is probably due to rotation. To definitively
     exclude a symmetric edema a repeat film could be performed.

     HISTORY:  Pneumonia requiring two-week course of antibiotics.  Bedside PICC
     attempted without success.
     
     PROCEDURE:  The procedure was performed by Drs. [**First Name (STitle) 1983**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 250**] with Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 250**] supervising throughout.  The left upper arm was prepped in a sterile
     fashion.  No suitable superficial veins were visible, therefore, ultrasound
     was used for localization of a suitable vein.  The lateral of the paired
     brachial veins was patent and compressible.  After local anesthesia with 2 cc
     of 1% lidocaine, the brachial vein was entered under ultrasonographic guidance
     with a 21-gauge needle.  A .018 guide wire was advanced under fluoroscopy into
     the superior vena cava.  Based on the markers on the guide wire, it was
     determined that a length of 42 cm would be suitable.  The PICC line was
     trimmed to length and advanced through a 4-French introducer sheath under
     fluoroscopic guidance into the superior vena cava.  The sheath was removed.
     The catheter was flushed.  Final chest x-ray was obtained.  Film demonstrates
     the tip to be in the superior vena cava just above the atrium.  The line is
     ready for use.  A Stat-Lock was applied and the line was heplocked.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a 42-cm total length 4-French single
     lumen left brachial PICC line with tip in superior vena cava, ready for use.
