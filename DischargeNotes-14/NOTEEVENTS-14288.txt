Admission Date:  [**3192-7-16**]       Discharge Date:  [**3192-7-23**]

Date of Birth:   [**3109-7-30**]       Sex:  F

Service:  NEUROLOGIC MEDICINE

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Left middle cerebral artery stroke.

NOTE:  The following history is as garnered from the
patient's daughter, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 446**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10414**], at telephone [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10415**].

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 82 year old
woman with Parkinson's disease and history of previous stroke
who recently suffered a left middle cerebral artery stroke,
status post TPA treatment, who is now being transferred to
the neurology floor.  Her recent history includes four days
of upper respiratory infection with signs and symptoms
including nonproductive cough and fatigue.

On [**3192-7-15**], the patient was at her Senior Center and had an
episode of right knee weakness which was initially attributed
to her arthritis.  However, by 4:00 p.m. that day, her knee
collapsed and she was quite weak; her daughter took her home
but she remained weak.  During this time, she continued to be
oriented and had no other problems.

She was taken to the [**Hospital3 1658**] where a diagnosis of
right lower lobe pneumonia was made and Levofloxacin started
in the Emergency Department at that time.  However, on
transfer to the [**Hospital3 1658**] floor, she was noted to have
a sudden onset of right sided arm and leg weakness and she
was unable to articulate but was still able to nod
appropriately to questions.

Head CT showed atrophy and the patient was transferred to
[**Hospital1 10**] for acute management of
stroke.

The patient underwent MR imaging study which showed decrease
water diffusion in the distribution of the left middle
cerebral artery without significant mass effect and she
received TPA at 5:10 a.m.  Post TPA, she has been stable but
clinically has not shown any appreciable improvement.  Repeat
CT is without bleed or evidence of increased intracranial
pressure.  Doppler without evidence of reflow.

At baseline, the patient lives with her daughter and is quite
functional, able to house chores and feed herself.  Per her
daughter, she had a nonproductive cough and fatigue for four
days with difficulty feeding herself the day prior to
presentation to [**Hospital3 1658**].  No fever, chills, chest
pain, palpitations, headache, loss of consciousness or focal
weakness except for the right knee weakness; she has had
urinary incontinence for the last six months.  Both the
patient's daughter and son-in-law were ill with the flu in
the days prior to presentation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Sepsis with pulmonary embolism some eleven years ago.
2.  Parkinson's disease diagnosed ten years ago.
3.  Macular degeneration.
4.  Stroke in the past with diagnosis by MR in [**3190**] but
without residual deficits.
5.  History of dilated ventricles first seen in [**3190**], but
repeat MR in [**3191**], was unchanged.
6.  Recently diagnosed B12 deficiency.

ALLERGIES:  Sulfa allergy as a child.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Carbidopa 25/100 t.i.d.
2.  Requip 0.25 mg t.i.d. (delusions at high doses).
3.  Amantadine 100 mg q.d.
4.  Detrol 2 mg b.i.d. p.r.n.
5.  Dulcolax p.r.n.
6.  B12 one q.week for four weeks which has been completed.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with her daughter and
son-in-law in [**Name2 (NI) 671**].  She was a homemaker without history
of ethanol or tobacco use.  Her neurologist is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 10416**].  Primary care physician is [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10417**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature maximum 100.2, temperature
current 98.8, heart rate 79, blood pressure 165/71, oxygen
saturation 100% on two liters.

General:  Elderly woman in no acute distress.

Head and Neck:  Normocephalic, supple, no lymphadenopathy, no
bruits.

Cardiovascular:  Regular rhythm, normal rate.

Pulmonary:  Clear to auscultation except some decreased
breath sounds on the right.

Abdomen:  Positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender,
nondistended.

Extremities:  Positive pulses.

Neurologic:  Arousible but sleepy.  She will close eyes to
command but not much else.  Nonverbal.

Cranial nerves:  The pupils are equal, round, and reactive to
light and accommodation, 3.0 millimeters going down to 2.0
millimeters.  Extraocular movements are full.  Blinks to
threat.  Closes eyes on command.  Right facial droop.

Motor:  Bulk is normal. Tone is somewhat flaccid on the
right.  The right arm and leg withdraw to pain.  Spontaneous
left arm movement.  Resting tremor on the left hand.  Right
arm and leg strength likely full.  Reflexes are 2+ in the
biceps bilaterally, trace in the triceps bilaterally,
brachial radialis 1+ bilaterally, patella 2+ on the left and
3+ on the right, no gastrocnemius.  Toes are downgoing on the
left and upgoing on the right.  Grasp reflex present on the
left hand.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 10.0, hematocrit
30.8, platelets 207,000.  Sodium 138, potassium 3.9, chloride
103, bicarbonate 22, blood urea nitrogen 16, creatinine 0.8,
and glucose 118.  Magnesium 2.0, calcium 8.1, phosphorus 3.1.

Electrocardiogram:  Normal sinus rhythm at 70, Q wave in lead
III, V1 and T wave inversion in II, III, aVF and V1 through
V5.  No acute ST changes.

MR imaging:  Decreased diffusion in the left middle cerebral
artery distribution, no mass defect.  CT scan post TPA
without bleed, no mass effect.

Chest x-ray:  From the outside hospital revealed a slight
right middle lobe opacity, no cardiomegaly and no effusion.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  As indicated above, the patient was
admitted after her new onset stroke and she received TPA
intravenously but there was no reflow on post TPA studies.
The patient clinically remained stable, however, did not have
any significant meaningful clinical improvement over the
course of the hospitalization.  She was initially responsive
to noxious stimuli with appropriate withdrawal.  She would
close her eyes to command.  However, on the day of this
dictation, she was no longer responsive even to midline
command of eye opening and closure.  She appeared
comfortable.

After further discussion with her family, both son and
daughter, a decision was made to focus on her comfort and
therefore, the patient was made comfort measures and referred
to Hospice.  She is currently clinically stable and
appropriate for transfer to a Hospice facility.  We
anticipate that the patient will be given Morphine and Ativan
as needed to keep her comfortable although we note that she
is currently very comfortable both from a respiratory
perspective and pain perspective without Ativan or Morphine.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Not improved.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharged to Hospice facility.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Left middle cerebral artery stroke without clinical
improvement despite TPA.
2.  Currently comfort measures and being transferred to a
Hospice facility.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  Morphine and Ativan as needed for
comfort.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Parkinson disease, sudden onset right arm weakness, right lower
     facial droop and difficulty speaking. Concern for left MCA infarct.
     
     No comparison studies available.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1 and T2 and diffusion weighted images of the brain
     were obtained with no administration of IV contrast.  3D time of flight MR
     angiography imaging of the brain was then obtained with 3D reconstruction
     images performed.
     
     MR BRAIN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Abnormal signal intensity is demonstrated on
     diffusion weighted images in the left periventricular deep white matter
     region, within the left MCA territory.  There is no significant mass effect or
     shift of midline structures.  The images are highly degraded due to patient's
     motion despite repeated attempts.
     
     MRA OF THE HEAD:  The supraclinoid portion of the internal carotid arteries,
     as well as ACA and MCA's are not included on this study due to patient's
     motion.  The left internal carotid arteries is occluded.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Left internal artery occlusion with left MCA territory acute
     stroke.  Limited study due to patient's motion.  The supraclavicular ICA, ACA,
     and MCA's are not included MR angiogram.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      82 year old woman with sudden h/o of fall and unconsciousness                   
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      ? haemorrhage

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATIONS:    Sudden history of fall and unconsciousness.
     
     TECHNIQUE:   Axial noncontrast Ct scans of the brain were obtained.
     
     COMPARISON:  Previous MRI from [**3192-7-16**].
     
     FINDINGS:   There is hypodensity involving the left insula, basal ganglia and
     portions of the left frontal lobe. There is probably also a component of
     hypodensity involving the anterior temporal lobe.    These areas represent
     edema from recent infarction in the distribution of the left middle cerebral
     arterial territory.  There is mild mass effect narrowing sulci. There is no
     shift of midline structures. There is no evidence of hyperdensity in this
     location or elsewhere in the brain to indicate acute hemorrhage. There are old
     cerebellar infarctions.  There are calcifications of the carotid ciphon.
     
     IMPRESSION:   Evolving left middle cerebral territory infarction.  No evidence
     of hemorrhage.
