4 to 6 mg p.o. q. 6 hours prn; Lantis 32 units each morning,
subcutaneously and to utilize a sliding scale with Humalog.

ALLERGIES:  Sulfa.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Significant for status post cadaveric
renal transplant in [**3141-1-29**].

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Married, no children, history of depression
with psychotic features.  No significant alcohol or tobacco
use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination on presentation, 98.2,
heartrate 78, blood pressure 130/70, breathing at a rate of
18, 99% on room air.  Fingerstick was 202 in the holding area
prior to her pancreas transplant.  Her head, eyes, ears, nose
and throat examination was normocephalic, atraumatic, mucous
membranes moist, anicteric, no cervical lymphadenopathy,
trachea midline and no jugulovenous distension, no bruit.
Cardiac examination was regular rate and rhythm.  Normal S1
and S2, no murmur, rub or gallop.  Pulmonary examination was
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdominal examination was
soft, nondistended, nontender.  She has a right lower
quadrant mask consistent with a prior renal transplant and
old incision in the right lower quadrant, it is well healed
and well approximated, no appreciable hernias.  Positive
bowel sounds.  Extremities are not edematous, palpable distal
dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial.  No ulcerations, no
venous stasis disease.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was sent to the Operating Room
and underwent a pancreas transplant.  She was sent to the
Surgery Intensive Care Unit postoperatively for her
management.  She was maintained on D5 [**1-30**] normal saline at
100 per hour.  She was kept NPO with an nasogastric tube.
She was on an insulin drip.  She was on Aspirin, Tacrolimus,
Mycophenolate, Octreotide, Antithymocyte globulin, had gotten
a dose of Pamidronate postoperatively, Pepcid, was being
maintained on Valcyte and perioperative Unasyn as well.
Ultimately over the next couple of days the patient was doing
well, transferred out to the floor by postoperative day #2,
off of insulin drip as her blood sugars came down under 130
range.  She was out of bed ambulating.  She continued to get
her thymoglobulin, Solu-Medrol taper.  She as on Cellcept 1
gm b.i.d. and was started on Prograf for the titration of her
immunosuppression.  Over the ensuing days, the patient did
quite well.  The Transplant and Nephrology Service was
following diligently.  They agreed she was not requiring any
type of diabetic feed.  She was tolerating a diet after
approximately postoperative day #5 when her nasogastric tube
had been out.  She was passing gas.  Her wound remained
without any evidence of local sepsis.  On postoperative day
#8, she developed a fever spike to 103 and focal pain over
her pancreas graft site.  She was ultimately started on
Zosyn.  Over the next day she continued to have focal
tenderness and some localized guarding over the graft site.
The thought was the patient possibly had pancreatic leak.
Therefore, she was consented for re-exploration.  She was
sent to the Operating Room for formal exploration.  At the
time of surgery when the wound was opened by Dr.
.................. there was noted to be at least 30 to 50 cc
of purulent discharge.  Ultimately cultures from the wound
discharge revealed that there was Klebsiella oxidosis
sensitive to Levaquin.  There was no evidence of pancreatic
leak or intra-abdominal abscess and it was surmised that the
patient's temperature spike and pain were all secondary to a
wound infection.  However, this was not clinically detected
at the bedside likely secondary to her immunosuppressive
state.  Postoperatively from this exploration the patient had
had an open wound that was being packed t.i.d.  There was
temporary placement of a vacuum-assisted closure dressing,
however, this was discontinued due to the fact that the wound
was still quite soupy and there was undermining of the left
lateral flap of the wound requiring formal packing and daily
debridement with dressing changes.  Postoperatively from the
second exploration the patient did actually require
in-patient psychiatric consultation as she became somewhat
disoriented.  She had no evidence of fever, sepsis or any new
medication changes that would explain the acute mental status
change.  The Psychiatric Service thought it was just a
reaction and variation of her underlying depression with
psychotic features and she was started on Zyprexa
accordingly.  Over the following days, the patient
defervesced quite appropriately and ultimately by [**3141-6-25**] the patient was cleared for discharge to home with a
visiting nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] with the dressing changes.  She had
had [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Known patient lastname 767**]-[**Location (un) 1527**] drain that had been placed during the
first operation at the original pancreas transplant and now
had been discontinued on postoperative day #4.  She had no
new drains placed after her re-exploration from [**3141-6-18**].
 During her hospitalization she required no insulin.  Her
renal function remained sound and ultimately she was deemed
appropriate and stable for discharge to home by [**3141-6-25**]
after consultation with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 339**] and Dr.
....................  Her discharge laboratory values were
significant for a white count of 12, hematocrit of 23.9 for
which she received 2 units of packed cells.  This hematocrit
had been drifting over several days and there was no evidence
of an acute bleed.  Platelet count was 446,000.  Chemistry
was significant for a sodium of 134, potassium 4.5, chloride
102, bicarbonate 21, BUN and creatinine 12 and 1.3 with a
serum glucose of 85.  Her magnesium was 1.4 which had been
repleted on the day of discharge.  Amylase and lipase value
of 68 and 49 were also noted.  Her last Prograf level prior
to this dictation was 9.4.

She was being maintained on Prednisone 7.5 mg p.o. q. day,
Cellcept 1000 mg p.o. b.i.d., Tacrolimus 1 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
Levaquin 500 mg p.o. q. day which had been started on [**6-23**].
 She will continue for an additional seven days from the time
of discharge, Valcyte 450 mg p.o. q. day, Protonix 40 mg p.o.
q. day, Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q. day, Clotrimazole troches one
tablet p.o. q.i.d., Metoprolol 200 mg p.o. b.i.d., Norvasc 10
mg p.o. b.i.d., Prozac 40 mg p.o. q. day, Hydralazine 25 mg
p.o. q.i.d., Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d., Tylenol prn, Ativan
q.h.s. 2 to 4 mg p.o. as well as Percocet 5/325 one to two
tablets p.o. q. [**5-4**] prn.  She was had been temporarily placed
on Dilaudid during her hospitalization.  She did not tolerate
this because it caused quite a bit of confusion and in
consultation with the patient's husband, herself as well as
the Psychiatric Consultation Liaison Service, Dilaudid has
been discontinued.  She was not receiving subsequent
analgesia from her Vicodin dosing and she could not be
maintained on Ultram secondary to the fact that Ultram and
Prozac can interact and may precipitate a possible serotonin
syndrome.  Therefore, the ultimate decision was made to just
send the patient home on Percocet as needed for pain.

FOLLOW UP DISCHARGE PLAN:  Discharge home with visiting nurse
and to follow up with Dr. ................. or Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 339**] in
the outpatient clinic at the Transplant Center in
approximately five to seven days from the time of discharge.

     INDICATION:  Status post pancreas transplant now with increasing left lower
     quadrant pain.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically-acquired axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were
     obtained with IV contrast.  Additional non-contrast images were obtained of
     the upper abdomen.  150 cc Optiray contrast was administered.  Non-ionic
     contrast was used secondary to patient debility.
     
     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     ABDOMEN CT WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:  Bibasilar atelectasis is
     appreciated.  A low-attenuation sub-cm lesion is present in the right lobe of
     the liver, adjacent to the gallbladder.  This partially fills in on delayed
     images, and likely represents a hemangioma.  No other liver lesions are
     identified.  The gallbladder is enlarged, but otherwise unremarkable.  The
     native pancreas is shrunken.  The spleen is unremarkable.  Both right and left
     adrenal glands appear normal.  Both right and left kidneys demonstrate only
     mild enhancement and are significantly atrophic and small in size.  Several
     simple cysts are present in the right and left kidneys.  The stomach, small
     bowel, and large bowel appear normal, without dilatation or wall thickening.
     There is no significant retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymph node enlargement.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The transplant kidney is identified, and enhances
     uniformly.  There is prompt excretion of contrast.  A single low-attenuation
     lesion is present in the mid pole of the transplant kidney.  This likely
     represents a simple cyst.  No perirenal fluid collections are identified.  The
     transplant pancreas is identified in the left lower quadrant.  There is a
     moderate amount of fluid around the transplant pancreas which extends into the
     left pelvis, along the iliac chain.  This is concerning for a pancreatitis.  A
     small amount of fluid is present in the cul-de-sac.  The uterus, adnexa, and
     rectum are unremarkable.  There is no abnormal lymph node enlargement in the
     pelvis.  A small hernia is identified in the left abdominal wall, at the level
     of the pelvic brim.  A tiny fluid collection is seen within this hernia sac.
     Surgical skin staples are noted along the anterior abdomen.
     
     The osseous structures reveal no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Status post pancreas transplant now with increasing left lower
     quadrant pain.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically-acquired axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were
     obtained with IV contrast.  Additional non-contrast images were obtained of
     the upper abdomen.  150 cc Optiray contrast was administered.  Non-ionic
     contrast was used secondary to patient debility.
     
     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     ABDOMEN CT WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:  Bibasilar atelectasis is
     appreciated.  A low-attenuation sub-cm lesion is present in the right lobe of
     the liver, adjacent to the gallbladder.  This partially fills in on delayed
     images, and likely represents a hemangioma.  No other liver lesions are
     identified.  The gallbladder is enlarged, but otherwise unremarkable.  The
     native pancreas is shrunken.  The spleen is unremarkable.  Both right and left
     adrenal glands appear normal.  Both right and left kidneys demonstrate only
     mild enhancement and are significantly atrophic and small in size.  Several
     simple cysts are present in the right and left kidneys.  The stomach, small
     bowel, and large bowel appear normal, without dilatation or wall thickening.
     There is no significant retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymph node enlargement.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The transplant kidney is identified, and enhances
     uniformly.  There is prompt excretion of contrast.  A single low-attenuation
     lesion is present in the mid pole of the transplant kidney.  This likely
     represents a simple cyst.  No perirenal fluid collections are identified.  The
     transplant pancreas is identified in the left lower quadrant.  There is a
     moderate amount of fluid around the transplant pancreas which extends into the
     left pelvis, along the iliac chain.  This is concerning for a pancreatitis.  A
     small amount of fluid is present in the cul-de-sac.  The uterus, adnexa, and
     rectum are unremarkable.  There is no abnormal lymph node enlargement in the
     pelvis.  A small hernia is identified in the left abdominal wall, at the level
     of the pelvic brim.  A tiny fluid collection is seen within this hernia sac.
     Surgical skin staples are noted along the anterior abdomen.
     
     The osseous structures reveal no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.

     Patient with increasing left lower quadrant pain. Evaluate for fluid
     collection in the peripancreatic region in the left lower quadrant.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  CT imaging of the abdomen and pelvis after the administration of
     100 ccs of contrast.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: The visualized portions of the lung bases are clear.
     The liver is normal in contour and attenuation with no evidence of biliary
     ductal dilatation .  There is a subcentimeter low attenuation lesion within
     the right lobe of the liver near the gallbladder fossa which is stable when
     compared with the prior examination and likely represents a hemangioma. The
     gallbladder is distended and otherwise unremarkable. There is no evidence of
     intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The native pancreas is atrophic. The
     spleen is unremarkable. The adrenal glands are within normal limits.  The
     patient's native kidneys are atrophic with bilateral simple cysts. There is
     minimal contrast enhancement without excretion in the patient's native
     kidneys. The visualized portions of large and small bowel demonstrate no
     abnormal dilatation or wall thickening with contrast reaching the descending
     colon.
     
     Along the anterior abdominal wall there is evidence of extensive fatty
     stranding an at the superior aspect of the patient's surgical incision there
     is a fluid collection with gas.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: There is a tiny bubble of air within the peritoneal
     cavity within the left lower quadrant of the abdomen.  The transplant kidney
     enhances and excretes contrast.  There is hypoperfusion of the medial
     portion of the transplant kidney.  There is an unchanged appearance of a
     likely simple renal cyst within the transplant kidney. There is a stable
     appearance of an extensive fluid collection tracking along the left ileopsoas
     musculature along the iliac vessels and surrounding the transplant pancreas
     within the left lower quadrant of the adomen. The transplant pancreas enhances
     uniformly.
     The uterus, adnexa, and rectum are unremarkable.  There is no evidence of
     lymphadenopathy within the pelvis. The appendix is of normal caliber and fills
     with air.
     
     Bone windows show no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesion.

     ductal dilatation .  There is a subcentimeter low attenuation lesion within
     the right lobe of the liver near the gallbladder fossa which is stable when
     compared with the prior examination and likely represents a hemangioma. The
     gallbladder is distended and otherwise unremarkable. There is no evidence of
     intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The native pancreas is atrophic. The
     spleen is unremarkable. The adrenal glands are within normal limits.  The
     patient's native kidneys are atrophic with bilateral simple cysts. There is
     minimal contrast enhancement without excretion in the patient's native
     kidneys. The visualized portions of large and small bowel demonstrate no
     abnormal dilatation or wall thickening with contrast reaching the descending
     colon.
     
     Along the anterior abdominal wall there is evidence of extensive fatty
     stranding an at the superior aspect of the patient's surgical incision there
     is a fluid collection with gas.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: There is a tiny bubble of air within the peritoneal
     cavity within the left lower quadrant of the abdomen.  The transplant kidney
     enhances and excretes contrast.  There is hypoperfusion of the medial
     portion of the transplant kidney.  There is an unchanged appearance of a
     likely simple renal cyst within the transplant kidney. There is a stable
     appearance of an extensive fluid collection tracking along the left ileopsoas
     musculature along the iliac vessels and surrounding the transplant pancreas
     within the left lower quadrant of the adomen. The transplant pancreas enhances
     uniformly.
     The uterus, adnexa, and rectum are unremarkable.  There is no evidence of
     lymphadenopathy within the pelvis. The appendix is of normal caliber and fills
     with air.
     
     Bone windows show no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesion.
                                                                 (Over)

     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Tiny air bubble within the peritoneal cavity within the left lower
     quadrant of the abdomen.  This could relate to the patient's recent
     debridement.
     
     2.  Transplant pancreatitis: with unchanged appearance of extensive fluid
     collection within the retroperitoneum of the left lower quadrant adjacent to
     the transplanted pancreas, compatible with pancreatic effusion.
     
     3.  Fluid collection with air located along the superior margin of the
     patient's abdominal wall incision.  This finding is concerning for abscess.
     
     4.  Hypoperfusion within the medial aspect of the transplant kidney which is
     unchanged when compared to the prior exam.

     quadrant pain.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired CT images were obtained from the lung bases
     through the pubic symphysis after 100 cc of Optiray.  Nonionic contrast was
     used given the patient's renal function.  Coronal reformats were constructed.
     
     CT ABDOMEN AFTER IV CONTRAST:  Multiple small free and loculated fluid
     collections in the left pelvis surrounding the pancreatic transplant are
     unchanged. The transplant pancreas enhances homogeneously.  Enteric contrast
     reaches the cecum and no contrast is seen within the bowel adjacent to the
     transplant. There is no bowel wall thickening or luminal dilatation.  The
     transplant kidney is identified within the right pelvis. There is stable
     decreased perfusion to the medial aspect of the transplant. There is no
     hydronephrosis or surrounding fluid collections.
     
     A focal hypodensity within the liver adjacent to the gallbladder has not
     changed since the prior exam.  No enhancing masses are seen within the liver.
     The gallbladder is distended but the wall is not thickened.  The native
     pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, and native kidneys are unchanged.  Several
     left para-aortic retroperitoneal lymph nodes have not changed since the study
     of [**3141-6-17**].  There is continued stranding around the patient's midline
     incision, which appears opened.  There is no abcess collection.
     
     CT PELVIS AFTER IV CONTRAST:  The bladder is well distended and the wall is
     not thickened.  There are no new pelvic masses.  The osseous structures are
     unchanged.  Extensive vascular calcifications along the iliac vessels, the
     native renal arteries, and splenic artery.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Stable appearance of the transplant pancreas and surrounding small
     fluid collections.  There is no drainable fluid collection.  There is no IV

     CT ABDOMEN AFTER IV CONTRAST:  Multiple small free and loculated fluid
     collections in the left pelvis surrounding the pancreatic transplant are
     unchanged. The transplant pancreas enhances homogeneously.  Enteric contrast
     reaches the cecum and no contrast is seen within the bowel adjacent to the
     transplant. There is no bowel wall thickening or luminal dilatation.  The
     transplant kidney is identified within the right pelvis. There is stable
     decreased perfusion to the medial aspect of the transplant. There is no
     hydronephrosis or surrounding fluid collections.
     
     A focal hypodensity within the liver adjacent to the gallbladder has not
     changed since the prior exam.  No enhancing masses are seen within the liver.
     The gallbladder is distended but the wall is not thickened.  The native
     pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, and native kidneys are unchanged.  Several
     left para-aortic retroperitoneal lymph nodes have not changed since the study
     of [**3141-6-17**].  There is continued stranding around the patient's midline
     incision, which appears opened.  There is no abcess collection.
     
     CT PELVIS AFTER IV CONTRAST:  The bladder is well distended and the wall is
     not thickened.  There are no new pelvic masses.  The osseous structures are
     unchanged.  Extensive vascular calcifications along the iliac vessels, the
     native renal arteries, and splenic artery.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Stable appearance of the transplant pancreas and surrounding small
     fluid collections.  There is no drainable fluid collection.  There is no IV
     contrast extravasation.  The contrast has not reached the bowel anastomosis
     associated with the transplant pancreas.  If desired, the patient can be
     rescanned tomorrow and when contrast has passed to this region.

     Informed consent was obtained from the patient and the risks of the procedure
     were explained including bleeding, infection and visceral injury.
     
     PREPROCEDURE CT SCAN:  Preprocedure CT scan again demonstrates a fluid
     collection tracking immediately deep to the pancreatic transplant in the left
     lower quadrant, and extending along the left psoas muscle.  The collection is
     largely unchanged from previous.  The remainder of the CT scan is not
     significantly previous.  Please refer to the previous CT scan report.
     
     CT FLUOROSCOPIC GUIDANCE:  CT fluoroscopic guidance was used throughout the
     procedure was essential in determining needle tip position.
     
     CT GUIDED ASPIRATION:  Using sterile technique, CT fluoroscopic guidance and a
     20 gauge spinal [**Last Name (LF) 10529**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] aspiration of the collection was performed.
     Approximately 7 cc of blood were aspirated.  No pus was seen.  The tip of the
     needle was confirmed to be within the collection using CT fluoroscopy.  The
     retrieved sample was sent for culture and sensitivity and gram stain.
     
     POST PROCEDURE CT SCAN:  Post procedure CT scan demonstrates some minimal
     decrease in size of the collection with a focus of air within the collection,
     confirming that the needle tip was in the right location.
     
     No complications were encountered.  1% Xylocaine was used as local analgesia.
     Systemic analgesia was administered under the supervision of a nurse.  Please
     refer to the nursing record.  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], attending radiologist, was

     CT GUIDED ASPIRATION.
     
     CLINICAL HISTORY:  39 year old woman status post pancreatic transplant now
     with fevers.  Please drain fluid surrounding the pancreas.
     
     COMPARISON STUDY DATED:  [**3141-7-14**].
     
     Informed consent was obtained from the patient and the risks of the procedure
     were explained including bleeding, infection and visceral injury.
     
     PREPROCEDURE CT SCAN:  Preprocedure CT scan again demonstrates a fluid
     collection tracking immediately deep to the pancreatic transplant in the left
     lower quadrant, and extending along the left psoas muscle.  The collection is
     largely unchanged from previous.  The remainder of the CT scan is not
     significantly previous.  Please refer to the previous CT scan report.
     
     CT FLUOROSCOPIC GUIDANCE:  CT fluoroscopic guidance was used throughout the
     procedure was essential in determining needle tip position.
     
     CT GUIDED ASPIRATION:  Using sterile technique, CT fluoroscopic guidance and a
     20 gauge spinal [**Last Name (LF) 10529**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] aspiration of the collection was performed.
     Approximately 7 cc of blood were aspirated.  No pus was seen.  The tip of the
     needle was confirmed to be within the collection using CT fluoroscopy.  The
     retrieved sample was sent for culture and sensitivity and gram stain.
     
     POST PROCEDURE CT SCAN:  Post procedure CT scan demonstrates some minimal
     decrease in size of the collection with a focus of air within the collection,
     confirming that the needle tip was in the right location.
     
     No complications were encountered.  1% Xylocaine was used as local analgesia.
     Systemic analgesia was administered under the supervision of a nurse.  Please
     refer to the nursing record.  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], attending radiologist, was
     present for the entire procedure.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Fine needle aspiration of collection within the abdomen yielding

     CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Patient with pancreatic transplant with mental status
     changes for further evaluation.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  T1 sagittal and FLAIR, T2, susceptibility and diffusion axial
     images of the brain were obtained without gadolinium.  Correlation was made
     with the head CT of [**3141-11-20**].
     
     FINDINGS:  There is mild prominence of ventricles and sulci inappropriate for
     patient's age.  No evidence of midline shift, mass effect or hydrocephalus is
     seen.  A few prominent perivascular spaces are seen in bilateral inferior
     basal gangliar region.  A subtle area of increased signal adjacent to the left
     lateral ventricle at the level of corona radiata could be due to a small
     lacune.  No acute infarct identified on the diffusion-weighted images.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Mild age inappropriate prominence of sulci.  Probable chronic
     lacune in the left periventricular white matter and left globus pallidus.  No
     mass effect, midline shift or hydrocephalus.  No acute infarct.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  39 year old female with biliary obstruction.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Images from an ERCP performed by the Gastroenterology Department
     were submitted for interpretation.
     
     There was successful cannulation of the common bile duct with opacification of
     the common bile duct, distal pancreatic duct, and cystic duct.  There is mild
     dilatation of the distal common bile duct, as well as several tiny, rounded,
     intraluminal filling defects which per report were found to be consistent with
     ampullary adenomas.  The distal pancreatic duct, cystic duct, and limited
     views of the intrahepatic ducts are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Two tiny rounded filling defects at the distal common bile duct
     associated with mild dilatation.  These findings are felt to be compatible
     with intraampullary adenoma and biopsies were obtained by report.

     INDICATIONS:  Status post renal and pancreatic transplants.  In need of PICC
     for long term antibiotics.
     
     PROCEDURE:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6335**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 250**] with
     Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 250**] supervising. The right upper arm was prepped in a sterile fashion.
     Since no suitable superficial veins were visible, ultrasound was used for
     localization of a suitable vein.   The basilic vein was patent and
     compressible.  After local anesthesia with 2 ml of 1% lidocaine, the basilic
     vein was entered under ultrasonographic guidance with a 21 gauge needle.  A
     0.18 guidewire was advanced under fluoroscopy into the superior vena cava.
     Based on the markers on the guidewires it was determined that a length of 33
     cm would be suitable. The PICC line was trimmed to length and advanced over a
     4 French introducer sheath  under fluoroscopic guidance into the superior vena
     cava. The sheath was removed. The catheter was flushed. A final chest x-ray
     was obtained. The film demonstrates the tip to be in the superior vena cava
     just above the atrium.  The line is ready for use.
     
     A stat-lock was applied and the line was hep locked.
     
     IMPRESSION:   Successful placement of a 33 cm total length 4 French single
     lumen PICC with its tip in the superior vena cava, ready for use.

     TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and axial, and FLAIR, T2 and susceptability axial
     images were  obtained before Gadolinium.  T1 axial, sagittal and coronal
     images were obtained following the administration of Gadolinium.
     
     COMPARISON: Previous MRI study of [**3141-11-22**].
     
     FINDINGS: On diffusion weighted images no evidence of an area of restricted
     diffusion is seen to indicate acute infarct.  FLAIR images are slightly
     limited by motion.  Mild age inappropriate prominence of sulci seen as before.
     No evidence of midline shift, mass effect or hydrocephalus noted.
     
     Following Gadolinium administration, there is an illdefined area of
     enhancement seen measuring approximately 15 mm x 5 mm in the left subinsular
     region.  No other abnormal enhancement identified.  No evidence of meningeal
     enhancement seen.
     
     IMPRESSION: Mild age inappropriate prominence of sulci as before.  Small area
     of enhancement in the left subinsular region without corresponding T2 or FLAIR
     abnormalities.  This could be secondary to an incidental capillary
     telangiectasia but given patient's history of seizure and infection, a close

     enhancement is seen. Findings discussed with the physician taking care of

     MRI OF THE BRAIN.
     
     CLINICAL HISTORY:  Mental status changes, seizure and pancreatic
     transplantation.  Follow up abnormal study.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar pre and post contrast T1-weighted images, axial T2-
     weighted, susceptibility, diffusion-weighted, and FLAIR images were obtained.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     On the current study, a focus of FLAIR hyperintensity is seen in the left
     corona radiata, probably present previously although not well seen due to
     motion artifact on the prior study.  It appears to have been present on
     [**3141-11-22**].  The ventricles and sulci are unchanged in size.  There is some
     opacification of the left mastoid air cells, new since the prior study.
     Minimal soft-tissue thickening is noted in the left maxillary sinus and there
     is opacification of some of the left ethmoid air cells, also new.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) The area of enhancement in the posteroinferior left insula is unchanged,
     suggesting that it may be related to an incidental vascular anomaly, such as
     capillary telangiectasia.
     
     2) There is a focus of FLAIR hyperintensity in the left corona radiata
     suggesting an old lacune, unchanged from [**3141-11-22**].
     
     3) There is new opacification of many of the left mastoid air cells and some
     of the left ethmoid air cells.

     MR BRAIN WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST:  There are no areas of abnormal

     focus of increased T2 and FLAIR signal with enhancement on the post-contrast
     images that likely a capillary telangiectasia, unchanged from the prior study.
     
     On the T2 weighted and FLAIR images, there is increased signal seen in the
     pons, in the head of the caudate bilaterally, portions of the insula, as well
     as in the medial temporal lobes bilaterally. The increased signal intensity in

     no mass effect associated with this increased signal intensity. These findings
     can be consistent with an inflammatory demyelinating process or viral
     encephalitis.
     
     The partially visualized paranasal sinuses are clear. There is some increased

     1) Non-enhancing increased T2 and FLAIR signal abnormalities in the pons and

     TECHNIQUE:   Multiplanar T1, T2 and susceptibility sequences are performed.
     Diffusion weighted imaging and post contrast enhanced sequences are also
     obtained.
     
     MRI OF THE BRAIN:  The area of enhancement in the posterior inferior left
     insula is unchanged and most likely corresponds to a capillary telangiectasia
     as previously described.  There are no other areas of abnormal enhancement
     intracranially.  The FLAIR/T2 hyperintensity within the bilateral basal
     ganglia and pons are unchanged from the previous study.  No other areas of
     abnormal signal intensity are seen.
     
     The diffusion weighted imaging is unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Unchanged appearance of enhancement in the posterior left insula most
     likely related to a capillary telangiectasia.  No other evidence of abnormal
     intracranial enhancement.
     2)  Unchanged T2/FLAIR hyperintensity within the bilateral basal ganglia and
     pons.  As described previously, this may represent a inflammatory or other
     demyelinating process.  However, in view of the patient's history of diabetes,
     chronic small vessel ischemia is the  most likely etiology.

     draped in standard sterile fashion. Since not suitable superficial veins were
     visible, ultrasound was used for localization of a suitable vein. The basilic
     vein was patent and compressible. After local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine,
     the basilic vein was entered under ultrasonographic guidance with a 21 gauge
     needle. A .018 guidewire was advanced under fluoroscopy into the superior vena
     cava. Based on the markers on the guidewire it was determined that a length of

     transplants status post seizure.
     
     The study is compared with a similar exam performed on [**3142-3-23**].
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     MRI of the brain with diffusion-weighted was performed without administration
     of contrast.
     
     Again noted is a questionable area of increased T2 signal in the bilateral
     basal ganglia and pons, which remain unchanged since prior exam.
     
     Diffusion-weighted images demonstrate increased signal in the anterior portion
     of the pons, which is of uncertain significance.
     
     In addition, on FLAIR images, there is a focal area of hypointensity noted in
     the right cerebellum, which is probably artifactual secondary to
     phase encoding artifact.  This was not present on the previous exam. No
     contrast administered during this is exam.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1. Persistent increased signal noed in the basal ganglia and pons on T2W and
     FLAIR images.  The signal abnormality in the pons appears more prominent on
     the present exam.  Differential considerations include inflammatory vs.
     demyelinating vs. chronic small vessel disease.
     
     2. On diffusion-weighted images, there is increased signal noted in the
     anterior pons of unknown clinical significance.

     from pulsations along the phase-encoding axis.
     
     No areas of abnormally restricted diffusion are seen on the appropriately
     sensitized sequences.
     
     The visualized superior orbits and their contents are normal.  Increased T2
     signal is seen within the left mastoid air cells, a new finding.  There is
     also a focus of increased T2 signal in the skull base anteroinferior to the
     left porus acusticus.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) Essentially unchanged foci of mild increased signal intensity in the T2-
     weighted sequences lying within the brain stem and medial inferior temporal
     lobes.  The import of this finding is unclear.
     
     2) Two areas of newly increased T2 signal in the skull base, one within the
     left mastoid air cells and the other just anterior to the left porus
     acusticus, in the region of the left petrous apex.  The findings should be
     correlated with the patient's clinical history.

     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Unenhanced CT of the chest.
     
     FINDINGS:  There are multifocal areas of focal opacity in both lungs,
     predominantly in the lower lobes.  The largest and most dense of these is
     located in the infrahilar region on the right.  There is a small adjacent
     cystic space superomedial to this finding.  The remaining peripheral areas
     have fainter density than the dominant area.  There are no lobar areas of
     consolidation.  There is no effusion or pneumothorax.  There is a right-sided
     central venous catheter terminating with its tip in the SVC.  There is
     coronary artery calcification.  There is dense calcification of the mitral
     valve annulus.  The pulmonary artery is enlarged at 4 cm suggesting pulmonary
     hypertension.  There is no adenopathy within the mediastinum.  There are
     several prominent lymph nodes in the region of the left renal hilum.  The
     kidneys are atrophic.  There is vascular calcification in the upper abdomen
     but otherwise, the upper abdomen is unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Multifocal lung opacities consistent with aspergillosis or other fungal
     infection such as nocardia.  Bacterial infection also considered.
     2.  Prominent lymph nodes in the left renal hilar region raising possibility
     of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder.  Some of the lung findings
     might be explained by such a diagnosis if not related to infection.
     3.  Enlarged pulmonary artery suggesting underlying pulmonary arterial
     hypertension.

     INDICATION:  Immunosuppression with pancreas and kidney transplant and
     pulmonary aspergillosis.
     
     Multiplanar T1 and T2W images of the brain are obtained.  T1 axial, coronal,
     and sagittal images are performed without and with Gadolinium administration.
     Comparison is made to the recent exam from [**3142-3-31**].
     
     There are no abnormalities seen on diffusion images.  T2 hyperintensity is
     again noted involving the insular and subinsular regions of the brain
     bilaterally.  There is also slightly increased T2 signal along the lower
     aspect of the pons.  There is mild enhancement seen along the left insular
     region following Gadolinium administration.  This could be related to either
     inflammatory or infectious etiology.  No midline shift or mass effect is seen.
     The ventricular system remains normal and symmetrical without hydrocephalus.
     Normal signal flow voids are noted within the intracranial portions of the
     carotid and basilar arteries.  There is mild generalized sulcal dilatation.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Slight enhancement noted in the left insular region following
     Gadolinium administration.  No change noted involving the T2 hyperintensity
     within both insular regions and the lower aspect of the brain stem.  These
     findings could be related to possible inflammatory disease, or graft vs. host
     reaction.  A neoplastic process is an unlikely consideration given the absence
     of edema.  Infectious etiologies including fungal disease are also to be
     considered in the differential diagnosis.  No other interval change is noted.

     HISTORY:  Status post kidney transplant with graft versus host disease and
     aspergillosis diagnosed by wedge resection in the left lower lobe on the 16th.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3142-4-2**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Unenhanced chest CT.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is a suture line in the left lower lobe at the site of
     previous small nodule representing wedge resection residua.  Adjacent to this,
     is marked increase in the pulmonary parenchymal opacity.  This seems to follow
     the suture line and it is not clear whether this represents parenchymal
     hemorrhage or advancement of the patient's known aspergillis infection.  There
     is a focal nodule in the right middle lobe which has increased since the 4th
     of March and is felt to represent progressive infection at that location.
     There is a large infrahilar nodule on the right which has increased slightly
     to just above 2 cm in size since the prior study, also felt to probably relate
     to the patient's known diagnosis of aspergillosis.  In addition, the study is
     limited by respiratory motion, but there are diffuse ground glass opacities in
     the upper lobes with septal thickening and a left pleural effusion.  The heart
     is enlarged.  The upper abdomen reveals no suspicious findings.  The bones are
     unrevealing.  A PICC catheter with its tip at the cavoatrial junction.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Pulmonary edema with left pleural effusion.
     2.  Increasing size of right-sided lung nodules since [**4-2**] suggesting
     progression of underlying diagnosis of aspergillosis.
     3.  Marked increase in opacity in left lower lobe adjacent to wedge resection
     suture line probably represents post surgical change & hemorrhage.

     disease, invasive aspergillosis.  Shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting.
     
     COMPARISON:  CT chest [**3142-4-15**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically-acquired non-contrast images were obtained from the lung
     apices through the symphysis pubis.  Contrast was not used secondary to the
     patient's elevated creatinine.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST:  The left pleural effusion is unchanged in
     appearance.  The 2 cm, right infrahilar nodule which most likely relates to
     the patient's known diagnosis of aspergillosis is unchanged in appearance. The
     right middle lobe nodule is also identified and unchanged.  There is vague,
     poorly-defined ground glass opacities through both lung fields.  This may
     relate to pulmonary edema, however, the patient is breathing during the study.
     There is an enlarged main and central pulmonary arteries (does patient have
     pulmonary hypertension?) which, when compared to previous study, is unchanged.
     There is a mild pericardial effusion as well as coronary calcifications.  The
     surgical sutures are again within the left lower lobe from previous wedge
     resection. The right subclavian PICC is unchanged in position.  Note is also
     made of dense calcification of the mitral annulus. The airways are patent down
     to the segmental bronchi.  Note is also made of a nodular, heterogeneous
     thyroid which is unchanged.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST:  Evaluation of the abdomen is somewhat
     limited due to lack of IV contrast.  There is evidence of anasarca.  The
     liver, gallbladder, and spleen are unremarkable.  The native atrophic kidneys
     are again identified.  No free air or localized fluid collections are
     identified within the abdomen.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  The transplanted kidney is identified
     within the right pelvic fossa.  The transplant pancreas is identified within
     the left pelvic fossa.  These are difficult to characterize with the lack of
     IV contrast.  There are some inguinal nodes which are on the borderline of
     pathologic enlargement.  There are extensive vascular calcifications
     throughout.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
       39 year old woman s/p kidney transplant w/ GVHD, invasive aspergillosis now w/ 
      shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting                 
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Please do CT of chest/abdomen/pelvis to r/o progression of aspergillosis, 
      effusion, or intraabdominal process
     CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST:
      elevated creatinine
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Status post pancreas/ kidney transplant, graft versus host
     disease, invasive aspergillosis.  Shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting.
     
     COMPARISON:  CT chest [**3142-4-15**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically-acquired non-contrast images were obtained from the lung
     apices through the symphysis pubis.  Contrast was not used secondary to the
     patient's elevated creatinine.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST:  The left pleural effusion is unchanged in
     appearance.  The 2 cm, right infrahilar nodule which most likely relates to
     the patient's known diagnosis of aspergillosis is unchanged in appearance. The
     right middle lobe nodule is also identified and unchanged.  There is vague,
     poorly-defined ground glass opacities through both lung fields.  This may
     relate to pulmonary edema, however, the patient is breathing during the study.
     There is an enlarged main and central pulmonary arteries (does patient have
     pulmonary hypertension?) which, when compared to previous study, is unchanged.
     There is a mild pericardial effusion as well as coronary calcifications.  The
     surgical sutures are again within the left lower lobe from previous wedge
     resection. The right subclavian PICC is unchanged in position.  Note is also
     made of dense calcification of the mitral annulus. The airways are patent down
     to the segmental bronchi.  Note is also made of a nodular, heterogeneous
     thyroid which is unchanged.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST:  Evaluation of the abdomen is somewhat
     limited due to lack of IV contrast.  There is evidence of anasarca.  The
     liver, gallbladder, and spleen are unremarkable.  The native atrophic kidneys
     are again identified.  No free air or localized fluid collections are
     identified within the abdomen.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  The transplanted kidney is identified
     within the right pelvic fossa.  The transplant pancreas is identified within
     the left pelvic fossa.  These are difficult to characterize with the lack of
     IV contrast.  There are some inguinal nodes which are on the borderline of
     pathologic enlargement.  There are extensive vascular calcifications
     throughout.
                                                                 (Over)

     VIEWS: Upright AP view compared with upright AP view from [**3142-4-21**].
     
     FINDINGS: The right sided PICC line remains in stable and satisfactory
     position. The heart remains stably enlarged. There is upper zone vascular
     redistribution and vascular engorgement, findings consistent with pulmonary
     edema. Again seen are areas of consolidation within both lower lobes, findings
     consistent with patient's known aspergillosis. No pneumothorax or left pleural
     effusion is identified. The right costophrenic angle is excluded from the
     study.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) Mild congestive heart failure.
     2) Unchanged, bilateral lower lobe areas of consolidation consistent with
     known aspergillosis.
