ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT)

Reason: perforation, obstruction, stent placement 

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
55 year old man with esophageal carcinoma, s/p stent placement 
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
perforation, obstruction, stent placement 
INDICATION: 55-year-old man with esophageal carcinoma, status 
post stent placement.

TECHNIQUE: Supine and upright abdominal radiographs.

No comparison.

FINDINGS: The patient is status post esophageal stent placement 
at lower esophagus and GE junction. Note is made of unremarkable 
bowel gas pattern with few air-fluid levels, without evidence of 
significant dilatation or obstruction. No evidence of ascites is 
seen on this radiograph. The osseous structures are 
unremarkable.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS; CT 100CC NON IONIC CONTRAST

Reason: please eval pulmonary embolism with CTA, but please also 
inc
Contrast: OPTIRAY

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
55 year old man with esophageal cancer, pleural effusions, 
worsening hypoxia 
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please eval pulmonary embolism with CTA, but please also include 
cuts to eval for worsening lung injury from chronic aspirations 
vs pneumonia, also eval size of pleural effusions 
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: Hypoxia, history of esophageal cancer.

COMPARISON: Non-contrast CT from a PET study of [**2724-1-10**], chest x-ray from [**2724-2-4**].

TECHNIQUE: Multidetector CT scanning was performed of the chest 
before and after the administration of 100 cc of Optiray 
intravenous contrast. Multiplanar reformations were obtained.

CT OF THE CHEST: Bilateral hilar as well as mediastinal 
adenopathy is seen. The heart and pericardium appear 
unremarkable. There is a dilated esophagus with a stent 
extending to the gastroesophageal junction. A central venous 
catheter seen with its tip terminating in the superior vena 
cava. The great vessels appear unremarkable. The pulmonary 
arteries do not demonstrate any central or segmental filling 
defects to suggest pulmonary embolism. Bilateral moderate 
pleural effusions are identified of simple fluid attenuation, 
which were not present on the [**1-10**] study. There has been 
new development of extensive ground glass and consolidative 
opacities involving the majority of the upper lobes bilaterally, 
as well as the lingula, right middle lobe, and lower lobes to a 
lesser extent. The airways are patent to the level of the 
segmental bronchi bilaterally.

In the visualized abdomen again seen are multiple 
low-attenuation masses within the liver, which appear to be 
increased in size and extent since the prior study of [**1-10**]. The osseous structures demonstrate no concerning lytic or 
sclerotic lesions.

IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral ground-glass and consolidative opacities involving 
multiple lobes, but most notably the upper lobes. This has 
developed since the prior CT of [**1-10**] and is worsened since 
the recent chest x-ray. These findings are most consistent with 
aspiration pneumonia, though there may be an element of 
superimposed pulmonary edema. Bilateral moderate-sized pleural 
effusions have also developed in the interim.
2. Dilated esophagus with a stent extending to the 
gastroesophageal junction. Extensive hilar and mediastinal 
lymphadenopathy. Multiple liver hypodensities consistent with 
metastatic disease.
3. No evidence of central or segmental pulmonary embolism.

These findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at 4:30 p.m. on 
[**2724-2-6**].

IMPRESSION: Esophageal stent in lower esophagus and GE junction. 
Unremarkable bowel gas pattern. Please also refer to the 
official report of chest radiograph obtained on the same day.

REPORT APPROVED DATE: [**2724-2-8**] 
SPECIMEN RECEIVED: [**2724-2-7**]    06-08976    BRONCHIAL WASHINGS 
  
SPECIMEN DESCRIPTION: Received 7.5 ml of bloody fluid and 1 
hematology 
  slide for referal. Total 2 slides. 
  
CLINICAL DATA: Known esophageal cancer, acute hypoxemic 
respiratory 
  failure. 
PREVIOUS BIOPSIES: 
 [**2723-8-10**]   [**3-/4167**]7   MEDIASTINAL LYMPH NODE 
 
 
REPORT TO: DR. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2176**] 
  
DIAGNOSIS: Bronchial lavage: 
    
  POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS consistent with 
  adenocarcinoma 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 55 yo male with metastatic esophagel cancer, recent ARF [**1-3**] 
dehydration who was transferred to ICU for increased oxygen 
demand, Lactic Acidosis, and Elevated WBC Count:  
.  
1. Increased oxygen demand/ARDS: Unclear etiology, initially 
thought to be secondary to pneumonitis/PNA 2x2 aspiration. There 
was no evidence of PE. BAL did not show an infectious etiology.  
Bacteremia was revealed by blood cultures.
Patient was initially treated with IV antibiotics and ARDS low 
volume ventilation strategy. Despite this measures, patient 
continue to be febrile, with elevated lactic acidosis and high 
WBC. Even an steroid trial was given but patient still required 
high FIO2.
.
Fevers and elevated WBC: Initially treated as a pulmonary 
source. Patient initially responded to antibiotics, but later on 
developed high grade fevers. Last blood cultured showed Gram 
positive cocci. 
.
Elevated Lactate. Persistent elevated lactate despite adequated 
CVP and Mix venous saturations. It was thought to be secondary 
to sepsis, with contribution of tumor burden and liver 
metaastasis.
.
Acute renal failure: thought to be secondary to prerenal 
azotemia in setting of sepsis. Creatinine remained at 1.4-1.6.
.
On [**2724-2-14**] a family meeting was held. The clinical situation was 
explained to the family worsening ARDS, severe dead space 
ventilation, worsening leukocytosis and fevers, associated with 
metastatic esophageal cancer gave him very low possibilities of 
recovery. Family felt that the medical team should direct goals 
of care towards confort at thats time. Patient passed away 
quietly in the presence of his family.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Esophageal cancer with persistent abdominal pain and reflux after
     stent placement on [**1-24**].  Evaluate for perforation, inflammation or
     intussusception.
     
     COMPARISON:  PET CT dated [**2724-1-10**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images through the abdomen and pelvis were
     obtained following the administration of oral and 150 cc of Optiray contrast.
     Coronal and sagittal reconstructions were obtained.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  There are small bilateral pleural effusions.
     There is atelectasis at the lung bases.  There is an esophageal stent in place
     at the gastroesophageal junction, in good position.  There is surrounding soft
     tissue density, consistent with an esophageal mass.  There are innumerable
     rounded low density liver lesions consistent with metastases, throughout the
     liver.  The size and number of lesions have significantly increased since
     [**1-10**].  The portal vein remains patient.  The gallbladder, spleen,
     pancreas and right adrenal gland are normal.  A large left adrenal mass is
     again noted, measuring 4.7 x 3.0 cm, and it is contiguous with adjacent
     lymphadenopathy.  The right kidney enhances and excretes normally.  There is a
     delayed nephrogram within the left kidney, and new moderate hydronephrosis on
     the left.  The proximal left ureter is dilated as well, to the level of left
     paraaortic lymphadenopathy.  The stomach, small and large bowel loops are
     unremarkable.  No free air within the abdomen.  There is interval worsening of
     paraaortic lymphadenopathy.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The bladder, prostate, seminal vesicles and
     rectum are normal.  There is sigmoid diverticulosis, without evidence of
     diverticulitis.  No free fluid in the pelvis, and no pathologically enlarged
     pelvic or inguinal lymph nodes.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious osteolytic or sclerotic lesions.  There
     are degenerative changes of the spine.
     
     Multiplanar reformatted images were essential in delineating the anatomy and
     pathology in this case
