HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 59 year-old
woman with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
and newly diagnosed small cell lung cancer with bony
metastases who presents to the Oncology Service as a transfer
from surgery for initiation of chemotherapy.  The patient had
There were two attempted biopsies of this mass without
diagnosis.  She was initially scheduled for a VATS procedure
on [**11-1**], but was admitted to an outside hospital on
[**10-30**] with worsening shortness of breath and severe
dysphagia and a temperature to 102.0.  She was started on
Ceftriaxone and Clindamycin at that time for a question of a
post obstructive pneumonia and was subsequently transferred
mediastinoscopy.  Mediastinoscopy on [**11-4**] was positive for a
small cell lung cancer.

Neurology was consulted on [**11-6**] and noted multiple cranial
nerve deficits including left VIII nerve deficit causing
decreased hearing, IX and X nerve deficits causing dysarthria
and dysphasia and a right XII nerve deficit causing right
tongue deviation.  Neurology recommended a head MRI and
lumbar puncture to rule out leptomeningeal disease at that
time.  CAT scan of the head with contrast was negative.  MRI
of the spine on [**11-8**] showed diffuse bony metastases and
epidural tumor in the lower thoracic spine.  There was also
the question raised of lower motor neuron disease as the
patient had weakness of her arms and legs.  Neurology also
raised the question of Lambert-Eaton syndrome as a
paraneoplastic condition to explain the patient's
intermittent dysphasia and hypophonia.  Follow up MRI of the
head was negative, but was notable for some motion artifact.
Today the patient is noted to be sleepy, but arousable
falling asleep when examined by the primary team prior to
transfer.  The patient was found to have dysarthric speech
and to have dysphagia for solids and liquids as well as to
have persistent right tongue deviation.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient denies headache, dizziness or
photophobia.  She complains of some bilateral shoulder pain.
She denies other pain.  There is no cough or sputum
production, but she is having difficulty clearing her oral
secretions.  Her last bowel movement was today.  She has no
complaints of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fevers, chills or
sweats.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  As described right upper lobe lung
mass initially noted in [**3157-8-21**] with recently diagnosed
small cell lung cancer with metastases to the vertebral
bodies.  2.  History of anxiety disorder.  3.  Chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease.  4.  Dysphagia.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has a one pack per day times
eighteen years history of smoking.  She denies alcohol or
drug use.

ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs temperature
98.1.  Pulse 88.  Blood pressure 120/80.  Respiratory rate
20.  Pulse ox 94% on room air.  Appearance, the patient is
awake, alert and oriented to place, interactive and following
commands.  HEENT she has dry oral mucosa.  There is no facial
droop.  There is right tongue deviation.  Oropharynx is
benign.  Palette elevation appears asymmetric.  Neck supple,
mildly tender to palpation with no lymphadenopathy.
Cardiovascular, regular rate and rhythm.  Normal S1 and S2
with no murmurs.  Lungs poor air movement with no wheezes or
crackles.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended with
active bowel sounds.  Extremities there is bilateral shoulder
pain to palpation.  There is full range of motion of the
other extremities.  The patient has some unspecified pain
with sitting up.  Cranial nerves, extraocular muscles are
intact.  Pupils are equal, round and reactive to light.
Visual fields intact.  Facial sensation is intact.  Facial
expression is intact.  The patient has positive jaw strength.
Hearing was not tested.  Her palette elevation is asymmetric.
She shrugs her shoulders and turns her head against
resistance with no obvious deficiency.  Strength is 5 out of
5 and equal bilaterally in the upper and lower extremities.

ADMISSION LABORATORY STUDIES:  White blood cell count 9.8,
hematocrit 28.8, platelets 166, sodium 139, potassium 3.7,
chloride 100, bicarbonate 26, BUN 6, creatinine 0.6, glucose
81, ionized calcium 1.32, magnesium 1.7, phosphate 3.1, INR
1.3, total bilirubin 0.8, AST 29, ALT 16, alkaline
phosphatase 118, albumin 2.7, TSH 11.0, uric acid 3.2,
ammonia of 50.  MRI of the brain on [**3157-11-8**] showed no clear
evidence of intracranial mass or metastasis, but was limited
by motion artifact.  MRI of the spine on [**11-8**] showed clearly
diffuse bony metastatic disease and epidural tumor in the
lower thoracic spine.

Pathology of [**3157-11-6**] for right paratracheal nodes positive
for metastatic small cell carcinoma.

Pertinent records from the [**Hospital3 1658**] where the patient
had been admitted prior to transfer for mediastinoscopy,
swallowing evaluation with question of hysterical etiology,
upper gastrointestinal study was negative for esophageal
narrowing.  Initial chest x-ray showed a new left lower lobe
and medial basilar segment right lower lobe infiltrate.
Repeat chest x-ray showed some slight improvement in the
pneumonia with a persistent lung mass and a small pleural
effusion.

Significant interventions at [**Hospital3 1658**] Hospital
included transfusion of two units of packed red cells for a
hematocrit of 24%.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Oncology:  The patient diagnosed with
small cell lung cancer with bony metastases.  She underwent
chemotherapy with etoposide from [**11-10**] to [**3157-11-12**] and
carboplatin on [**3157-11-9**].


 She also underwent whole brain x-ray
therapy for presumed leptomeningeal disease as the source of
her cranial nerve deficits causing dysphagia.  A lumbar
puncture was attempted on the evening of admission in order
to analyze spinal fluid for evidence of leptomeningeal
involvement.  The lumbar puncture was unsuccessful and was
not further pursued on the recommendation of the Neurology
Service who felt that it would put the patient at risk for
inadvertent seating of the cerebral spinal fluid.  As noted
the MRI of the brain was negative, but MRI of the spine did
show a leptomeningeal enhancement consistent with dural
metastases as well as diffuse metastatic disease of the lower
thoracic, lumbar and sacral spine.

2.  Neurological:  The patient's cranial nerves deficits were
attributed to leptomeningeal involvement.  As noted
previously the patient was put on Decadron.  MRI of the spine
showed no evidence of cord compression.  The patient was
noted to have some right upper and lower extremity weakness.
This was attributed to possible nerve root involvement
consistent with diffuse metastases in the vertebral bodies.
The patient's depressed mental status on admission gradually
cleared over the course of her hospitalization.  It was
attributed to either medications, the patient's
hypothyroidism, which was treated with Levoxyl and/or initial
hypercalcemia, which was treated and corrected appropriately
with Pamidronate.

3.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient exhibited dysphagia
secondary to cranial nerve deficits.  A swallowing study was
performed, which confirmed the patient's aspiration.  The
patient's medications were converted to intravenous or per
duotube.  The patient was put on aspiration precautions.  A
duotube was placed several days into the admission for
purposes of nutrition.  Subsequent to that a PEG tube was
placed for more long term nutritional needs.

4.  Renal:  The patient was noted to have a gradually
worsening hyponatremia over the course of this admission.
Urine lytes and urine osmolarity studies suggested that the
patient's hyponatremia was most consistent with SIADH a not
uncommon finding in the presence of small cell lung cancer.
The patient was treated with free water restriction as well
as with demeclocycline.  The patient's sodium gradually
corrected from a low of 126 to approximately 130.  The
patient was given minimal free water boluses following
nutrition through the PEG tube.  The patient had poor urine
output through much of this admission, but remained
essentially euvolemic with a stable normal creatinine.

5.  Infectious disease:  The patient completed a fifteen day
course of Clindamycin and Levofloxacin for bilateral
pneumonia diagnosed at the outside hospital.  Given the
patient's history of dysphagia this was most likely
aspiration versus a post obstructive pneumonia.  On [**3157-11-20**]
approximately eight days after completing chemotherapy with
carboplatin and etoposide, the patient spiked a fever to 100.1
while neutropenic.  She was started empirically on
Ceftazidime and cultures were sent.

6.  Hematological:  The patient's initial hematocrit was low
and iron studies revealed that the anemia was most consistent
with anemia of chronic disease.  Post chemotherapy the
patient required transfusion for a hematocrit of 23 on
[**3157-11-20**].  Platelets were also depressed following
chemotherapy.  There was no active bleeding.

7.  Pulmonary:  The patient experienced an episode of acute
respiratory failure with left lung collapse following PEG
tube placement on [**3157-11-18**].  The patient was emergently
intubated and persistently hypoxic despite 100% FIO2.
Emergent bronchoscopy revealed a large mucous plug in the
left lung.  After removal of the plug the patient's
oxygenation improved to normal.  The patient was extubated
approximately 24 hours later and subsequently returned to the
floor with no significant neurological deficits.  The patient
did, however, have evidence of a persistent left lower lobe
collapse on chest x-ray.  The patient will in the future
require aggressive oropharyngeal suctioning, aspiration
precautions as well as avoidance of all po medications until
the dysphagia is resolved.  It remains unclear whether the
patient will regain her ability to swallow and a trach tube
may need to be entertained ultimately for assurance of
adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

Please see addendum for additional information regarding
hospital course as well as discharge medications and
instructions.

     COMPARISON:  [**3157-11-5**].
     
     Compared to the prior study there is new prominence in the region of the
     azygous vein.  Question if this is due to vascular engorgement due to possible
     supine positioning or related to the recent mediastinoscopy.  There is no
     pneumothorax or evidence of pneumomediastinum.  There is blunting of the left
     costophrenic angle consistent with pleural effusion which was present on the
     prior study.  However there has been increased opacity behind the left side of
     the heart which likely represents increased left lower lobe volume loss. There
     is a new linear density in the right cardiophrenic angle likely representing
     atelectasis as well.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.  Increased
     opacity at the left base likely due to increasing left lower lobe volume loss.
     Increased opacity in the region of the azygous vein, question engorgement of
     the azygous vein due to supine positioning.

     TECHNIQUE:  Sagittal T1, T2 and inversion recovery scans of the cervical and
     thoracic spine were obtained.  Axial T1 weighted images are provided from the
     T11-12 interspace superiorly to T9.
     
     Axial images demonstrate heterogenous bony signal intensity.  All vertebrae
     appear to be abnormal and probably are infiltrated with metastatic tumor.
     Limited axial images were obtained and they demonstrate paravertebral abnormal
     soft tissue and expansion of a few ribs, consistent with neoplastic
     infiltration of bone.  there is also evidence of epidural soft tissue in the
     lower thoracic spinal canal, consistent with tumor in the epidural space.
     There is some impression on the spinal cord, though in the area examined
     complete compression is not seen.
     
     IMPRESSION;  Thoracic spine MR was performed but is limited in scope. There is
     clearly diffuse bony metastatic disease and there is epidural tumor in the
     lower thoracic spine, where axial images were obtained.
     
     Findings have been reported to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] of thoracic surgery at 2:40 p.m. on

     INDICATION:  Small cell lung cancer with epidural metastasis seen on thoracic
     MRI.
     
     T1 and T2 weighted sagittal images of the lumbosacral spine, with limited
     axial images through the lower thoracic region and post Gadolinium enhanced
     axial images through the lumbar spine were performed.  There is diffusely
     abnormal marrow signal intensity involving the entire visualized portion of
     the lower thoracic, lumbar spine and the sacrum including the pedicles and the
     posterior elements consistent with diffuse metastatic infiltrative disease.
     There is pathologic compression deformity of T11 with mild retropulsion
     posterolaterally on the right abutting the ventral aspect of the lower
     thoracic cord.  There is diffuse epidural disease anteriorly within the lower
     aspect of the thoracic canal.  Abnormal leptomeningeal enhancement is seen
     surrounding the lower aspect of the thoracic cord consistent with dural
     metastasis.
     
     Pathologic compression deformity and retropulsion is also noted involving the
     L5 vertebral body resulting in mild to moderate stenosis of the canal. Annular
     bulges are seen at L3/4 and L4/5 levels.  Diffuse involvement of the sacrum is
     noted.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Extensive metastatic disease involving the entire lower thoracic,
     lumbar spine and the sacrum with epidural metastatic disease involving the
     lower thoracic region.  There is abnormal enhancement consistent with
     leptomeningeal metastatic disease surrounding the lower aspect of the thoracic
     cord and conus.
     
     Pathologic compression fractures and retropulsions are noted at T11 and L5
     with compromise of the canal and mild compression of the ventral aspect of the
     cord.  Most of the findings in the lower thoracic spine were seen and
     described on a separate MRI examination performed earlier on [**3157-11-8**].
     
     There is moderate stenosis of the canal at L5/S1 level due to the pathologic
     compression and retropulsion of L5 as described above.

     A right PICC line has been placed, and terminates within the superior vena
     cava.  No pneumothorax is identified.
     
     There remains evidence of right mediastinal and right hilar lymph node
     enlargement a well as an ill-defined peripheral opacity in the right upper
     lobe.
     
     The heart size is within normal limits for technique.  Dense left retrocardiac
     opacity is unchanged and a small left pleural effusion is minimally smaller.
     Patchy opacity in the right retrocardiac region appears slightly improved.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1)  Satisfactory placement of right PICC line.  2)  Right
     mediastinal and right hilar lymph node enlargement with ill-defined peripheral
     opacity in right upper lobe likely due to known history of lung cancer.
     3)  Left lower lobe opacity, concerning for pneumonia, with adjacent pleural
     effusion.

     History:  This is a 59 year-old woman with cc of right lung with acute oxygen
     desaturation following PEG placement.
     
     Chest, portable:  Comparison is made to a prior study of [**3157-11-12**].  The heart
     size is difficult to evaluate due to mediastinal shift and to the left with
     complete opacification of the left apex.  The left lower lobe is somewhat
     aerated and this is improved in comparison to the prior study.  Again noted is
     a lobulated nodular density in the right mid lung zone.  The right lung
     appears clear.  An ET tube is seen in satisfactory position.  A right PICC is
     identified with its tip in the mid SVC.
     
     Impression:
     1.  Interim development of collapse of the left upper lobe. This is most
     likely related to a mucus plug.
     2.  Improved aeration of the left lower lobe. The results were discussed with
     the resident taking care of the patient.

     FINDINGS:  A single AP upright chest film.  This is compared with the previous
     study taken earlier the same day.  There has been virtually complete
     reexpansion of the left upper lobe following aspiration of a mucous plug.
     However, there is now once again evidence of collapse and consolidation of the
     left lower lobe which was previously partially reexpanded.  There is an
     associated small pleural effusion on the left side with blunting of the CP
     angle.  The right lung remains well-inflated.  The small nodular lesion in the
     right mid zone laterally is again noted.  The ETT and the right subclavian
     central line remain in satisfactory positions.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Reexpansion of left upper lobe but recollapse of the left lower
     lobe are demonstrated.

     CLINICAL:  New diagnosis of lung cancer.  Staging evaluation.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Oncology protocol torso CT utilizing 150 cc Optiray at patient
     request.
     
     CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  Images of the chest reveal a 1 x 1.5 cm mass which
     appears to lie in the inferior aspect of the right upper lobe posteriorly.  A
     right hilar node is also present, which measures approximately 1 x .75 cm.  No
     additional pulmonary parenchymal or mediastinal abnormalities are identified.
     Scattered bolus changes are present in the lungs, as well as some left pleural
     thickening with some basilar scar.
     
     ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST:  The abdomen appears unremarkable,
     including the liver and adrenal glands.  No adenopathy or abnormal fluid
     collections are identified.  A G tube is present.
     
     PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  Images of the pelvis reveal no masses, adenopathy or
     other abnormalities.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  Bone sequences reveal diffuse degenerative changes and somewhat
     osteoporotic appearing bone with no focal abnormalities identified.

     CT OF THE CHEST, ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST:
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helicalliy acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from teh
     thoracic inlet to the pubic symphysis after the administration of 150 cc o
     Optiray contrast.  Optiray used secondary to patient's history of pulmonary
     disease.   Precontrast images were obtained through the liver.  Images are
     degraded by motion artifact.
     
     COMPARISONS:  [**3157-12-19**].
     
     CT ABDOMEN W/O AND W CONTRAST:  The liver, spleen, pancreas, gallbladder,
     kidneys, ureters, and small and large bowel loops are normal in appearance.
     There are no pathologically enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph
     nodes.  The percutaneous G tube is noted and appears well positioned with the
     tip in the stomach.
     
     CT PELVIS W IV CONTRAST:  Small and large bowel loops are normal in
     appearance.  No pathologically enlarged inguinal or deep pelvic
     lymphadenopathy.  The distal ureters and urinary bladder are normal in
     appearance.  No free fluid or free air in the pelvis.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  In the inferior portion of the right upper
     lobe, there is redemonstration of a 9 x 14 mm nodule which, allowing for
     differences in technique, is unchanged in appearance from the prior study.
     There is interval decrease in the pneumonitis in the lung periphery beyond the
     nodule.  There is no change of the small right hilar mass.  Diffuse
     emphysematous changes are noted in the lung bases.  Soft tissue windows reveal
     no mediastinal or axillary lymphadenopathy.  The airways are patent. The
     heart, pericardium and great vessels are normal in appearance.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No interval change in right upper lobe and right hilar masses.
     Slight interval decrease in pneumonitis in the lung periphery beyond the right
     upper lobe mass.  Diffuse emphysematous changes.

     kidneys, ureters, and small and large bowel loops are normal in appearance.
     There are no pathologically enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph
     nodes.  The percutaneous G tube is noted and appears well positioned with the
     tip in the stomach.
     
     CT PELVIS W IV CONTRAST:  Small and large bowel loops are normal in
     appearance.  No pathologically enlarged inguinal or deep pelvic
     lymphadenopathy.  The distal ureters and urinary bladder are normal in
     appearance.  No free fluid or free air in the pelvis.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  In the inferior portion of the right upper
     lobe, there is redemonstration of a 9 x 14 mm nodule which, allowing for
     differences in technique, is unchanged in appearance from the prior study.
     There is interval decrease in the pneumonitis in the lung periphery beyond the
     nodule.  There is no change of the small right hilar mass.  Diffuse
     emphysematous changes are noted in the lung bases.  Soft tissue windows reveal
     no mediastinal or axillary lymphadenopathy.  The airways are patent. The
     heart, pericardium and great vessels are normal in appearance.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No interval change in right upper lobe and right hilar masses.
     Slight interval decrease in pneumonitis in the lung periphery beyond the right
     upper lobe mass.  Diffuse emphysematous changes.

     HISTORY:  Lung cancer, new upper and mid back pain.
      
     INTERPRETATION:  Whole body views of the skeleton show mildly increased tracer 
     activity within a length of the mid right humerus and focally in the distal  
     bilateral femurs.
      
     The kidneys and bladder are visualized, the normal route of tracer excretion.
      
     IMPRESSION:  Increased tracer activity within the right humerus and bilateral 
     distal femurs is worrisome for metastatic disease.  Plain radiographs of these
     sites have been requested. /nkg

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      59 year old woman with Small cell lung ca with mets to thoracic and lumbar

      PO intake, worsening rib and back pain, and constipation. No bowel/bladder
      incontenence. No LE weakness/sensory defecit. No saddle anestesia. Please

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Lung cancer metastatic to entire spine and extremities.  Severe
     back pain.  Worsening rib and back pain.  Constipation.  No incontinence.  No
     lower extremity weakness.
     
     COMPARISON:  Spine MR is from [**3157-11-11**] and [**3157-11-8**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Whole spine T1 and T2 weighted sagittal MR images with
     corresponding T1 weighted axial images pre and post gadolinium administration.
     
     FINDINGS:  The examination is limited by motion, rendering the axial images
     non-diagnostic.  The vertebral bodies are unchanged in shape and alignment,
     with continued mild compression deformity at T11 and L5.  The marrow signal is
     diffusely abnormal throughout all vertebral bodies with heterogeneous T1 and
     T2 signal, and marked enhancement.
     
     The intervertebral discs are normal in height and display normal signal
     
     There is no sclear evidence of cord compression by a soft tissue or bony
     mass. The epidural tumor identified on the prior studies at approximately the
     T11 level is not apparent on today's study secondary to the motion
     degradation. On sagittal images, after gadolinium administration, there is
     enhancement along the margins of the spinal cord and a linear interrupted
     pattern which is unchanged from the prior study and suggestive of
     leptomeningeal metastatic disease. Correlation with CSF studies could confirm
     this.  At T10-11, there is infolding of the posterior ligaments again noted.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Unchanged appearance of diffuse vertebral involvement by
     metastatic disease and leptomeningeal enhancement.  Degree of epidural disease
     is not well assessed on today's examination secondary to patient motion
     artifacts.

      Contrast: MAGNEVIST Amt: 10
     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      59 year old woman with Small cell lung ca with mets to thoracic and lumbar
      vertebrae, ribs, humerus, and B distal femurs admitted with lethargy, decreased
      PO intake, worsening rib and back pain, and constipation. No bowel/bladder
      incontenence. No LE weakness/sensory defecit. No saddle anestesia. Please
      evaluate. If any questions, please call [**Doctor Last Name 622**] 90307. 
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      evaluate for epidural lesions/cord compression
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Lung cancer metastatic to entire spine and extremities.  Severe
     back pain.  Worsening rib and back pain.  Constipation.  No incontinence.  No
     lower extremity weakness.
     
     COMPARISON:  Spine MR is from [**3157-11-11**] and [**3157-11-8**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Whole spine T1 and T2 weighted sagittal MR images with
     corresponding T1 weighted axial images pre and post gadolinium administration.
     
     FINDINGS:  The examination is limited by motion, rendering the axial images
     non-diagnostic.  The vertebral bodies are unchanged in shape and alignment,
     with continued mild compression deformity at T11 and L5.  The marrow signal is
     diffusely abnormal throughout all vertebral bodies with heterogeneous T1 and
     T2 signal, and marked enhancement.
     
     The intervertebral discs are normal in height and display normal signal
     
     There is no sclear evidence of cord compression by a soft tissue or bony
     mass. The epidural tumor identified on the prior studies at approximately the
     T11 level is not apparent on today's study secondary to the motion
     degradation. On sagittal images, after gadolinium administration, there is
     enhancement along the margins of the spinal cord and a linear interrupted
     pattern which is unchanged from the prior study and suggestive of
     leptomeningeal metastatic disease. Correlation with CSF studies could confirm
     this.  At T10-11, there is infolding of the posterior ligaments again noted.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Unchanged appearance of diffuse vertebral involvement by
     metastatic disease and leptomeningeal enhancement.  Degree of epidural disease
     is not well assessed on today's examination secondary to patient motion
     artifacts.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Metastatic small cell cancer, rule out mass.
     
     COMPARISONS:  [**3157-11-7**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images were obtained from the foramen magnum to
     the cranial vertex pre- and post-administration of 100 cc Conray.
     
     CT HEAD WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST:  There is no intra- or extra-axial
     hemorrhage. There is no mass effect or shift of normally midline structures.
     The ventricles are mildly more prominent than on the prior examination.  No
     enhancing lesions are present.  The paranasal sinuses and osseous structures
     are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No CT evidence for metastatic disease.
