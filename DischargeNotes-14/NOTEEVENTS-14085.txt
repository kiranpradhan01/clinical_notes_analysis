     INDICATION:  Mediastinal tumor, thymic carcinoma versus non-squamous cell lung
     cancer.  Status post two cycles of chemoradiation.
     
     COMPARISONS:  FDG PET/CT [**2661-7-29**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial MDCT images were obtained through the lungs after the
     administration of 100 cc of non-ionic Optiray contrast.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  The anterior mediastinal mass measures
     approximately 3.7 x 5.7 cm and does not appear significantly changed in size
     when compared to the previous PET/CT; however, the technique used between the
     two studies (PET/CT is a non-contrast non-breathhold study) is slightly
     different, which makes exact comparison difficult.  The mass partially
     surrounds the aorta and main pulmonary artery.  There are enlarged adjacent
     left-sided hilar and prevascular nodes.  There is an 8-mm right-sided upper
     paratracheal node and smaller lower right-sided paratracheal nodes.  No
     extension into the chest wall is identified.  There is a moderate- to large-
     sized pericardial effusion, which appears increased in size. There are no
     pleural effusions bilaterally. Note is made of a prominent arterial collateral
     arising from the celiac axis, likely the inferior phrenic artery, which
     extends up the anterior left chest wall to supply the region of the tumor. The
     pulmonary artery appears partially compressed by the tumor but widely patent
     without evidence of pulmonary emboli. There are tiny, noncalcified nodules
     within the right lower lobe (series 3, image 22) and the left lower lobe
     (series 3, image 27). There is atelectasis within the right middle lobe and
     lingula. Limited views of the upper abdomen are unremarkable.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Anterior mediastinal mass which partially surrounding the aorta and
     pulmonary artery with enlarged left hilar lymph nodes appears stable.  No
     chest wall invasion is identified.
     2.  Moderate- to large-sized pericardial effusion, which has increased in size
     when compared to the previous exam.

Echo [**9-24**]
Conclusions:  
1. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic 
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall 
motion is normal.  
2. There is a large, circumferential pericardial effusion with 
fibrin deposits  on the surface of the heart. There is sustained 
right and left atrial invagination, consistent with low filling 
pressures or early tamponade. There is significant, accentuated 
respiratory variation in mitral valve inflow, consistent with 
impaired ventricular filling.  
3. Compared with the findings of the prior report (tape 
unavailable for review) of [**2657-1-26**], the pericarial effusion and 
tamponade are new.
. 
Cath [**9-25**]
Resting preprocedure hemodynamics revealed equalization of 
pressures 
between the RA (RA mean pressure 11mmHG) and the pericardium 
(12mmHg) 
consistent with tamponade physiology. The Cardiac output was 
3.24L/min with an index of 2.12L/min/m2. 
2. Successful drainage of 400cc serosanguinous fluid from 
pericardial 
space. 
3. Post intervention RA pressure was 8mmHg and pericardial 
pressure was 2mmHg. Post procedure cardiac output was 4.36L/min 
with an index of 2.84L/min/m2. 
.
Echo [**9-25**] post procedure
1. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely 
depressed with  paradoxical septal motion.  
2.There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

.
Echo [**2661-9-27**]
Conclusions:  
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. 
Resting regional  wall motion abnormalities include hypokinesis 
of the anterior septum and anterior walls. The remaining 
segments are mildly hypokinetic (?related to tachycardia). Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There 
is a 1.2cm echogenic space seen anterior to the right 
ventricular free wall in the subcostal view - c/w organized 
effusion, hematomya, or tumor.  There is no evidence for RV 
diastolic collapse/tamponade physiology.    
Compared with the prior study of [**2661-9-26**], the anterior 
echogenic space is  more prominent/larger - but the views are 
not directly comparable and may be related to technical factors. 
 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
A&P:  69 yof with mediastinal mass ?thymic ca vs nscla with 
malignant pericardial effusion now s/p pericardial drainage 
transfer to CCU for mgmt.
.
[]Cardiac: 
Ischemia - no history of CAD, not on any meds outpt aside from 
lipitor, continued lipitor inhouse.

Pump - Patient with significant cardial effusion with 
equalization in pressures consistent with temponade now s/p 
pericardial effusion removal 400cc.  Cardiac ouput increased 
~30% post procedure.  However per post cath echo pt with 
continued depressed EF.  Repeat echo the following day revealed 
that pt continued to have mild hypokinesis however not clear if 
this due to the views vs. pt being tachycardic.  Patient should 
have repeat echo in 1 week time to evaulate this further.
.
Rhythm - Sinus.  Tachy at times upto 120s.
.
[] Pericardial Effusion - Drain in place post procedure and 
monitored on tele.  DDx for pleural effusion is wide however 
given the cell count with numerous RBC, this is likely 
hemorrhagic pericardial effusion.  Potential etiologies for 
hemorrhagic effusions include Malignancy ��� 26%, Percutaneous 
interventional procedures ��� 18%, Postpericardiotomy syndrome ��� 
13%, Complications of myocardial infarction (free wall rupture, 
thrombolysis) ��� 11%, Idiopathic ��� 10% Uremic ��� 7%, Aortic 
dissection ��� 4%, Trauma ��� 3%, and Other ��� 8 percent according to 
the latest study in Chest 1999 Dec;116(6):1564-9.
.
In conjunction with the history the most likely etiology in this 
patient was thought to be malignancy vs. other causes especially 
s/p mediastinal radiation.
- f/u cytology to evaluate for possible malignancy.  Pt will 
follow up with oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10103**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  
- Repeat Echo in 1 week to see progression of the effusion.
.
[] Heme/Onc - mediastinal mass, ?thymic vs. NSCLC.
s/p 2 cycles of cisplatin/etoposide with concomitant radiation 
therapy.
- XRT per heme/onc after discharge.
- f/u fluid cytology.
- pt will f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10103**].

Discharge Instructions:
[**Doctor First Name 54**] were admitted for fluid around [**Doctor First Name **] heart. The cause of this 
is not know at this time but lab tests on the fluid are pending 
and [**Doctor First Name **] should talk with your doctors about the results. 
.
We did see that your heart does not seem to pump blood optimally 
on the echocardiogram [**Doctor First Name **] had performed. This is likely due to 
the limitations of the testing mode and the fact that your heart 
was beating quickly at the time of the test. We do NOT feel [**Doctor First Name **] 
are at risk for heart failure at this time. 
Talk with your oncologist if [**Doctor First Name **] have any further questions and 
feel free to ask him to set [**Doctor First Name **] up with a cardiologist if [**Doctor First Name **] 
prefer.  
[**Doctor First Name 54**] will need to have another echocardiogram in one week to 
reassess your heart.  Please call for an appointment: ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 10104**]
 
Followup Instructions:
Feel free to call for an appointment with a cardiologist, Dr. 
[**Last Name (STitle) 3771**], whom cared for [**Doctor First Name **] during this admission. 
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 2910**].

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: LUNG CA RESTAGING   
       
     METHODS: Approximately 1 hour after intravenous administration of F-18   
     fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), noncontrast CT images were obtained for attenuation
     correction and for fusion with emission PET images. [The noncontrast CT images
     are not used to diagnose disease independently of the PET images.]  A series of
     overlapping emission PET images was then obtained. The fasting blood glucose
     level, measured by glucometer before injection of FDG, was 78  
     milligram/deciliter. The area imaged spanned the region from the skull base   to
     the mid-thighs.  
        
     Computed tomography (CT) images were co-registered and fused with emission PET
     images to assist with the anatomic localization of tracer uptake.  The
     determination of the site of tracer uptake seen on PET data can have important
     implications regarding the significance of that uptake.   
       
     INTERPRETATION:  
     On today's study, the previously seen anterior mediastinal mass appears
     decreased in size and FDG-avidity. There are focal areas of the previously noted
     mass and mediastinal lymph nodes which are FDG-avid with maximum SUV 4.5.  
       
     There is symmetric, mild increased tracer uptake is seen in the parotid glands,
     most likely related to inflammation.  
       
     There is FDG-avidity in the rectum and anal canal, unchanged from prior study.  
       
     Physiologic uptake is seen in the heart, gastrointestinal and genitourinary
     tracts.  
        
     IMPRESSION: 1. Interval improvement of the FDG-avid disease in the anterior
     mediastinal mass and mediastinal lymph nodes. There is residual FDG-avid disease
     in a portion of the mass and anterior mediastinal lymphnodes.

     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT images of the chest were obtained with
     intravenous contrast.  100 cc of Optiray contrast were administered.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2661-9-20**] chest CT.
     
     CHEST CT WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is a large heterogeneous anterior
     mediastinal mass, which is closely apposed to the great vessels.  There is
     also soft tissue density extending through the chest wall consistent with
     invasion.  The mass has decreased in size in the interval.  This now measures
     3.1 x 5.3 cm.  On the prior study, this measured 3.7 x 5.7 cm at the same
     location.  A small pericardial effusion is present, which has decreased in
     size in comparison to the prior study.  Multiple small mediastinal lymph nodes
     are present and unchanged.  The largest is in the precarinal region and
     measures 1 cm in short axis dimension.
     
     [**Hospital1 **]-apical pleural scarring is present and unchanged.  There are multiple tiny
     pulmonary nodules, which are all stable from the prior study.  Several of
     these are ground-glass in attenuation.  There is focal bronchiectasis and
     patchy ground glass-opacity in the right middle lobe inferiorly.  This is
     unchanged from the prior study and likely due to a chronic inflammatory or
     postinfectious etiology.  No new lesions are present.
     
     The osseous structures are unremarkable.  Visualization of the upper abdominal
     organs reveals no abnormalities.

     MR CHEST .
     
     There is comparison CT from [**2661-10-23**].
     
     CLINICAL HISTORY:  Thymic carcinoma versus nonsmall cell lung cancer in
     anterior mediastinum, evaluate.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1, T2, and dynamic post-gadolinium T1-weighted images
     were obtained.  Reformatted images were generated at a separate dedicated
     workstation and were valuable in helping to delineate the thoracic anatomy.
     
     FINDINGS:  An enhancing mass is present in the anterior mediastinum extending
     from the aortic arch caudally to the level of the main pulmonary artery.  At
     its greatest dimension, at the level of the manubrium, this enhancing mass
     measures 2.9 x 5.5 cm in the transverse and AP dimensions.  There is invasion
     into the anterior left thoracic wall.  There is abnormal enhancement of the
     pericardium.  There is abnormal enhancement of a subcarinal lymph node,
     although the subcarinal lymph node does not meet imaging criteria for
     pathologic enlargement.  There is no contour abnormality involving the aorta
     to suggest vascular invasion, however, there is no fat plane between the aorta
     and the abnormal soft tissue mass.
     
     Coronal images demonstrate a simple cyst in the upper pole of the right
     kidney.  Sagittal T2-weighted images demonstrate an abnormal increased signal
     intensity in the pedicle of an upper lumbar vertebra, it is incompletely
     evaluated on this study.  There is a hiatal hernia present.
     
     IMPRESSION:  
     1.  Soft tissue mass in the anterior mediastinum invading into the anterior
     left thoracic wall and abutting the aorta without intervening fat plane.  The
     appearance of this mass is not significantly changed since the CT examination
     from [**2661-10-23**]. These findings can see be seen in both thymic carcinoma and
     nonsmall cell lung cancer.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
     
     INDICATION:  History of allergies, broncho-mediastinitis and sternotomy.  Now
     scheduled for radical resection of medial sternum on [**2661-11-5**].  Preoperative
     chest examination.
     
     FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views are analyzed in direct comparison with
     the next previous chest examination of [**2661-10-10**].  Heart size is
     unchanged and within normal limits.  No typical configuration abnormality is
     noted.  There is some blunting of the contours in the pulmonary artery
     segment, a finding which was noted on the previous examination.  The contour
     of the thoracic aorta, however, is unremarkable and unchanged.  Pulmonary
     vasculature is normal.  No new acute parenchymal infiltrates are present and
     the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses remain free.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No interval change in chest findings since [**2661-10-10**]. 
     For detail of mediastinal abnormalities, see corresponding MRI, CT and FDG
     imaging that have occurred during the interval.

     INDICATIONS:  69-year-old woman status post resection of mediastinal mass.
     
     CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW:  Comparison is made to the preoperative study from
     [**2661-10-31**].  The patient is intubated.  The tip of the endotracheal tube
     lies at the thoracic inlet.  A nasogastric tube enters the stomach, and its
     distal-most course is not visualized on this film.  There are two chest tubes
     in the left hemithorax, as well as a chest tube at the right lung base.  A
     third drain overlying the midline may represent a mediastinal drain.  There
     are new sternotomy wires, and surgical clips in the mediastinum, as well as
     staples overlying the left upper chest.  A right internal jugular central
     venous catheter terminates in the superior vena cava.
     
     Allowing for differences in technique, the heart size is probably unchanged.
     There is perhaps slight mediastinal shift towards the left side, but this view
     is also significantly rotated. There is no definite pneumothorax or pleural
     effusion. There are bilateral hilar opacities, which may represent mild edema
     or postoperative changes, associated with mild mediastinal widening. Fullness
     in the left hilar region in the aortopulmonary window is also noted.
     
     IMPRESSION: Postoperative appearance of the chest, with lines, tubes, and
     drains as described. Continued follow-up is recommended to follow for
     resolution of likely post-operative changes, including mediastinal widening.

     AP CHEST, 8:48 A.M. ON [**11-7**]
     
     HISTORY:  Status post resection of mediastinal mass.
     
     IMPRESSION:  AP chest made available for review on [**11-11**] and compared to
     [**11-5**] and 7:
     
     The left mediastinal contour is inseparable from opacity that extends all the
     way to the left lateral chest wall.  This is probably a combination of
     mediastinal fluid collection, pleural fluid and atelectasis in the left lung,
     worsened appreciably over the past 24 hours.  Right lung is hyperinflated and
     clear.  There is no pneumothorax.  Right heart border is displaced to the left
     indicating a significant component of atelectasis.
     
     Right jugular sheath tip projects over the junction of the brachiocephalic
     veins.  Bilateral pleural and midline drains are in place.  Endotracheal tube
     has been removed and no nasogastric tube is seen, explaining significant
     gaseous and fluid distention of the stomach.

     PORTABLE CHEST:  The ETT, NGT, and mediastinal tubes have been removed.  The
     right IJ introducer has been exchanged for a triple lumen catheter with the
     tip in the proximal right atrium.  The right and left chest tubes remain in
     position.  There is a moderate left pleural effusion as well as a retrocardiac
     consolidation.  Small lucency in the left lower thorax likely represents air
     in the stomach. There is a small right pneumothorax which was not present on
     prior exam.  There is continued mild pulmonary vasculature congestion and
     increased interstitial markings consistent with mild pulmonary edema. Osseous
     and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Small right pneumothorax, new from prior exam.  Moderate-to-left
     pleural effusion, increased compared to prior exam.  Retrocardiac
     consolidation which may represent compressive atelectasis.

     COMPARISON:  [**2661-11-7**].
     
     INDICATION:  Pneumothorax.
     
     A chest tube remains in place in the right hemithorax.  There is a small right
     apical pneumothorax, which has slightly decreased in size compared to the
     previous study.  Within the left hemithorax, there is a moderate left pleural
     effusion, slightly decreased in size in the interval, with persistent adjacent
     opacity in the lingula and left lower lobe.  There is an increasing area of
     confluent opacity in the right lower lobe centrally, which contains air
     bronchograms, and note is also made of perihilar haziness and a subtle
     interstitial pattern, new in the interval.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Slight decrease in size of right apical pneumothorax.
     2.  Slight improvement in moderate left pleural effusion.
     3.  Right infrahilar airspace opacity, which may reflect an area of
     asymmetrical pulmonary edema or developing pneumonia.

     remains stable.  The right apical pneumothorax is slightly smaller.  The
     position of the right basilar chest tube is unchanged.  There is a layering
     left pleural effusion with probable subsegmental atelectasis in the left lung
     base.  The right paracardiac patchy opacity shows no significant change, which
     may represent pneumonia.  The patient is status post median sternotomy.  There
     are surgical clips overlying the mediastinum.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Biapical pneumothoraces, slightly larger on the left.  No
     significant change since the previous examination of [**2661-11-8**].  Left
     pleural effusion with left basilar atelectasis.
     
     Right paracardiac parenchymal opacity likely represents pneumonia, no

     INDICATION:  69-year-old female status post resection of mediastinal mass, now
     postop day #3 with removal of right and left chest tubes and increased pain in
     the right chest.
     
     Portable upright chest radiograph of [**2661-11-10**], at 21:08 is compared
     to the prior study of [**2661-11-10**], at 18:34.
     
     FINDINGS:  There are stable bilateral right and left apical small
     pneumothoraces.  Again seen is increased opacity overlying the left lung
     inferiorly that likely represents a combination of effusion and
     atelectasis/infiltrate.  There is a stable small right pleural effusion.  A
     right infrahilar opacity represents infection versus atelectasis.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Bilateral apical pneumothoraces are stable compared to the prior chest
     radiograph.
     
     2.  Stable small right pleural effusion.
     
     3.  Left lower lobe opacity likely representing a combination of effusion and
     atelectasis. Right infrahilar opacity, likely atelectasis. Infectious process
     is not fully excluded in either of these locations.

     INDICATION:  69-year-old female with mediastinal tumor, likely representing
     thymic carcinoma.  Suspected sternal infection.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial CT imaging of the chest obtained after the intravenous
     administration of 100 cc of Optiray.  Comparison made to a preoperative CT
     from [**2660-10-23**].
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  Thrombus is present within the left internal
     jugular vein and subclavian veins, a finding in keeping with the patient's
     history of left innominate vein resection. Graft material along the left
     anterior chest wall along replaces the resected portions of the sternum and
     several left anterior ribs.  Fluid is present posterior to this graft material
     within the anterior mediastinum measuring 2.5 x 5.3 cm (series 2, image 20).
     Fluid is also present anterior to this graft material measuring 6.2 x 2.4 cm
     (series 2, image 22).  No rim-enhancing fluid collections or gas are seen
     within the anterior mediastinum.  The superior vena cava is patent.
     Pericardial thickening, presumably postsurgical in nature, is seen.
     
     A small loculated right pleural effusion measures 4.3 x 1.2 cm.  Areas of
     nodular enhancement within the left pleural space are seen inferiorly (series
     2, image 46) measuring up to 1 cm in thickness.  Atelectasis is present within
     the right middle lobe as well as both lung bases.
     
     No pulmonary nodules or areas of frank consolidation are seen.
     
     In the imaged upper abdomen, limited views of the spleen, liver, adrenal
     glands, kidneys, and bowel are normal.
     
     No bone lesions worrisome for malignancy are seen.  In the superficial soft
     tissues of the anterior chest wall, a postsurgical defect adjacent to the
     patient's sternum is seen that contains some gas. The patient's sternotomy
     wires appear intact.

     (Cont)
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Fluid collections position anterior and posterior to the patient's
     chest wall graft material.  While no gas or rim-enhancing fluid collections
     are present within the mediastinum or deep soft tissues of the chest, an
     infectious component in this fluid cannot be excluded.
     
     2.  Areas of enhancing pleural thickening within the inferior left pleural
     space could represent postsurgical change; however, given the patient's
     history of thymic carcinoma, this could represent pleural-based metastatic
     disease and close interval followup is suggested.
     
     3.  Multiple increased small mediastinal lymph nodes that could be reactive in
     nature; however, these mediastinal lymph nodes should be monitored on
     subsequent followup examinations.
     
     4.  Thrombus within the left internal jugular [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] expected finding given
     the patient's history of innominate vein resection.
     
     5.  Small loculated right-sided pleural effusion.

     INDICATION:  68-year-old woman with mediastinal mass status post chemo and
     XRT, shortness of breath and fever postop.
     
     CHEST PORTABLE:  Comparison is made to a prior study of [**2661-11-12**].  The heart
     size is difficult to evaluate but is unchanged.  The mediastinal and hilar
     contours are stable.  There are small bilateral effusions which are stable. 
     There is plate-like atelectasis in the left mid lung zone which is new. 
     Overall, there is improved aeration of the lower lobes bilaterally.  The
     previously identified small apical pneumothoraces have completely resolved.
     
     IMPRESSION:  New atelectasis in the left mid lung zone.  No change in the
     small bilateral pleural effusions.  Opacities in the lung basis bilaterally
     have improved.

     INDICATION:  68-year-old woman with mediastinal mass status post chemotherapy
     and XRT.
     
     CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  Comparison is made to a prior study of [**2661-11-28**].  The heart
     is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  The
     pulmonary vasculature is normal.  In comparison to the prior study there has
     been resolution of the bilateral pleural effusions.  There is slight blunting
     of the left costophrenic angle likely representing scarring.  The previously
     identified posterior displacement of the suprasternal fragment is not as well
     seen today.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Resolution of the previously identified pleural effusions and
     stable post-surgical changes in the chest.
