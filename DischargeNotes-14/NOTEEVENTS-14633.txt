HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 80 year old
female with a history of diabetes, hypertension and
hypercholesterolemia and a questionable history of myocardial
infarction who was to undergo laparoscopic placement of
peritoneal dialysis catheter on [**3213-5-24**]. However, the
beginning of the procedure was complicated by bowel
perforation via trocar placement. The procedure was converted
to an open procedure and the perforation was closed. No
peritoneal dialysis catheter was placed. For operative
details, please see operative note. There was a small pinhole
injury at the transverse colon which was repaired. There was
no gross peritoneal contamination identified. The patient was
stable. Postoperatively, the patient did well, was afebrile
and the vitals were stable. However, the postop course was
complicated by bouts of atrial fibrillation and the patient
was seen by Cardiology immediately postoperatively. The
patient had a brief, about 30 minute, bout of atrial
fibrillation postop in the setting of decreased blood
pressure thought to be secondary to sedation and converted
spontaneously and the blood pressure improved. However, over
the course of the next few days, the patient continued to go
back into atrial fibrillation and was ultimately placed on
amiodarone drip.

ALLERGIES:  ACE inhibitor causes increased K.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Lopressor 150 mg bid, levofloxacin
250 mg qd, Flagyl 500 mg tid, Valsartan 80 qd, Lipitor 20.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General - HEENT - pupils are equal,
round, react to light and accommodation. Extraocular muscles
were intact. Sclera are anicteric. Neck was supple without
lymphadenopathy. Heart is regular rate and rhythm with no
murmurs, rubs or gallops. Abdomen is soft, nontender and
nondistended.

LABORATORY:  PT is 26 and INR of 1.3. Sodium is 143, K is
4.3, chloride 104, bicarb 23, BUN 51, creatinine 2.7, glucose
311.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On postop Day 1, the patient was continued
on Levo/Flagyl and continued to be followed by the Renal
Team. In order to initiate dialysis, the patient had a
Permacath placed by Interventional Radiology on postop Day 4.
The patient was followed for her increasing sugars. The
patient was on insulin drip until postop Day 3. On postop Day
6, she began to tolerate a diet and had frequent dialysis on
Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday schedule. The patient's sugars
were well controlled on an insulin regimen. Physical Therapy
evaluated the patient on [**3213-5-31**] and deemed her suitable
for rehabilitation secondary to generalized weakness. The
patient had been in normal sinus rhythm 48 hours prior to
discharge on stable PO amiodarone regimen. She was changed to
Levo/Flagyl PO on [**3213-6-3**] and discharged to Rehabilitation
on [**6-4**] on postop Day 11, Levo/Flagyl Day 12.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Iatrogenic bowel perforation status
post attempted peritoneal dialysis catheter placement
laparoscopically converted to open procedure, status post
postop atrial fibrillation, acute renal disease with
hemodialysis status post Permacath placement.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient was discharged to
Rehabilitation and instructed to follow up with Transplant
Service at the next available visit. She was to call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10987**] for an appointment.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  The patient was discharged on
medications of levofloxacin 250 mg po q48h, Coumadin 1 mg po
hs, Flagyl 500 mg po tid, Flagyl and Levo for two weeks,
Lopressor 50 mg po tid, amiodarone 400 mg po qd, insulin
sliding scale and Pepcid 20 mg po qd.

     INDICATION:  Attempted Tenckhoff catheter placement for peritoneal dialysis
     complicated by bowel perforation, now needs tunnedled line for long-term
     dialysis access.
     
     PHYSICIANS:  Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2267**] (Resident), Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 5804**] [**Name (STitle) 952**] (Fellow), and
     Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 553**] [**Name (STitle) 250**], the attending radiologist, who was present and supervising.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  After explaining the risks and benefits of the procedure,
     written informed consent was obtained.  The patient was placed supine on the
     angiographic table.  The right neck was prepped and draped in the usual
     sterile fashion.  Ultrasound was used to document a patent right internal
     jugular vein.  Hardcopy ultrasound images of the vein were taken before and
     during venopuncture.  The skin and subcutaneous soft tissues at the right
     internal jugular site were anesthetized using approximately 5 cc of Lidocaine.
     Under continuous sonographic guidance, a micropuncture needle was advanced
     into the internal jugular vein.  A 0.018 guidewire was then advanced through
     the needle.  A skin [**Doctor Last Name **] was made, and the needle was removed and exchanged
     for the micropuncture sheath sets.  The inner portion of the sheath and the
     wire were removed.  A 0.035 short [**Doctor Last Name 555**] guidewire was then advanced through
     the sheath and into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.  The
     length of the catheter was measured and determined to be a 24 cm tip to hub
     catheter. The exit site for the tunnedled portion was anesthetized using 5 cc
     of 1% Lidocaine.  The tract to the internal jugular puncture site was also
     anesthetized using and additional 5 cc of 1% Lidocaine.  The incision for the
     tunnedled exit was then made.  The catheter was attatched to the tunneler,
     which was advanced to the internal jugular puncture site.  At this point, the
     micropuncture sheath was removed from the internal jugular guidewire, and the
     tract was serially dilated to accomodate the dialysis catheter.  The stiffener
     was advanced through both lumens of the sheathless dialysis catheter system,
     and the dialysis catheter was advanced over the wire into the right atrium,
     under direct fluoroscopic guidance.  The stiffener and wire were then removed.
     The catheter was flushed.  The internal jugular puncture site was sutured
     using 2,O Dexon, using a single simple suture.  The catheter hub was secured
     to the anterior chest wall using O Dexon.  An additional sutured anchored the
     catheter at the tunnedled exit site, using 2,O Dexon.  The catheter was
     heplocked.

     tunnedled exit was then made.  The catheter was attatched to the tunneler,
     which was advanced to the internal jugular puncture site.  At this point, the
     micropuncture sheath was removed from the internal jugular guidewire, and the
     tract was serially dilated to accomodate the dialysis catheter.  The stiffener
     was advanced through both lumens of the sheathless dialysis catheter system,
     and the dialysis catheter was advanced over the wire into the right atrium,
     under direct fluoroscopic guidance.  The stiffener and wire were then removed.
     The catheter was flushed.  The internal jugular puncture site was sutured
     using 2,O Dexon, using a single simple suture.  The catheter hub was secured
     to the anterior chest wall using O Dexon.  An additional sutured anchored the
     catheter at the tunnedled exit site, using 2,O Dexon.  The catheter was
     heplocked.

     INDICATION:  Attempted Tenckhoff catheter placement for peritoneal dialysis
     complicated by bowel perforation, now needs tunnedled line for long-term
     dialysis access.
     
     PHYSICIANS:  Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2267**] (Resident), Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 5804**] [**Name (STitle) 952**] (Fellow), and
     Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 553**] [**Name (STitle) 250**], the attending radiologist, who was present and supervising.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  After explaining the risks and benefits of the procedure,
     written informed consent was obtained.  The patient was placed supine on the
     angiographic table.  The right neck was prepped and draped in the usual
     sterile fashion.  Ultrasound was used to document a patent right internal
     jugular vein.  Hardcopy ultrasound images of the vein were taken before and
     during venopuncture.  The skin and subcutaneous soft tissues at the right
     internal jugular site were anesthetized using approximately 5 cc of Lidocaine.
     Under continuous sonographic guidance, a micropuncture needle was advanced
     into the internal jugular vein.  A 0.018 guidewire was then advanced through
     the needle.  A skin [**Doctor Last Name **] was made, and the needle was removed and exchanged
     for the micropuncture sheath sets.  The inner portion of the sheath and the
     wire were removed.  A 0.035 short [**Doctor Last Name 555**] guidewire was then advanced through
     the sheath and into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.  The
     length of the catheter was measured and determined to be a 24 cm tip to hub
     catheter. The exit site for the tunnedled portion was anesthetized using 5 cc
     of 1% Lidocaine.  The tract to the internal jugular puncture site was also
     anesthetized using and additional 5 cc of 1% Lidocaine.  The incision for the
     tunnedled exit was then made.  The catheter was attatched to the tunneler,
     which was advanced to the internal jugular puncture site.  At this point, the

     INDICATION:  80 year old female with cold and painful left lower extremity.
     Please perform arteriography.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 258**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 259**] and Dr.
     [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 553**] [**Name (STitle) 250**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 250**], the staff radiologist, was present and supervising
     throughout.  After the risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with
     the patient and informed consent was obtained, the patient was placed supine
     on the angiography table.  Her left upper extremity was prepped and draped in
     the standard sterile fashion.  The skin and subcutaneous tissues in the
     antecubital fossa were anesthetized with 3 cc of 1% lidocaine.  The left
     brachial artery was accessed using a 21 gauge micropuncture needle in the
     retrograde fashion.  A .018 guidewire was advanced through the access needle
     into the axillary artery under fluoroscopic visualization.  The skin entry
     site was incised with an #11 blade scalpel.  The access needle was exchanged
     for a 5 FR micropuncture sheath and inner dilator.  The inner dilator and
     guidewire were removed.  A .035 [**Last Name (un) 528**] wire was advanced through the
     micropuncture sheath into the axillary artery.  An exchange was then made for
     a 5 FR angiographic sheathr.  After the inner dilator was removed, the sheath
     was assembled to a continuous saline flush.  A 5 FR pigtail catheter was then
     advanced over the [**Last Name (un) 528**] wire into the ascending aorta.  The [**Last Name (un) 528**] wire was
     exchanged for a guidewire.  Using this combination, the catheter was advanced
     into the abdominal aorta.
     
     With the catheter positioned at the L1 vertebral level, an abdominal aortogram
     was performed.  This demonstrated patent renal arteries bilaterally.  The
     right limb of the aortobifemoral bypass graft was widely patent.  The left
     limb was occluded.  The native left common iliac was visualized but is
     severely diseased throughout.  The native SFA is occluded.  There is
     reconstitution of the profunda femoris artery.  The above knee popliteal
     artery is patent.  There is focal plaque present in the below knee popliteal
     artery.  At the level of the trifurcation, the anterior tibial artery is
     patent with mild stenosis proximally.  The peroneal and posterior tibial
     arteries are occluded.  The anterior tibial artery remains patent to the foot.
     There is a short focal occlusion of the dorsalis pedis artery.  There is
     retrograde filling of diseased plantar branches.  After the arteriogram was
                                                                 (Over)

     bypass graft.  The right limb is patent.
     
     2.  Left lower extremity arteriography revealed a present but severely
     diseased native common iliac artery.  There is reconstitution of the profunda
     femoris.  The superficial femoral artery is occluded but there is
     reconstitution of the above knee popliteal artery.  There is focal stenosis
     present in the below knee popliteal.  At the level of the trifurcation, there
     is a single vessel runoff via the anterior tibial artery with mild stenosis
     proximally.  There is a short focal occlusion of the dorsalis pedis artery.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  80 year old female with cold and painful left lower extremity.
     Please perform arteriography.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 258**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 259**] and Dr.
     [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 553**] [**Name (STitle) 250**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 250**], the staff radiologist, was present and supervising
     throughout.  After the risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with
     the patient and informed consent was obtained, the patient was placed supine
     on the angiography table.  Her left upper extremity was prepped and draped in
     the standard sterile fashion.  The skin and subcutaneous tissues in the
     antecubital fossa were anesthetized with 3 cc of 1% lidocaine.  The left
     brachial artery was accessed using a 21 gauge micropuncture needle in the
     retrograde fashion.  A .018 guidewire was advanced through the access needle
     into the axillary artery under fluoroscopic visualization.  The skin entry
     site was incised with an #11 blade scalpel.  The access needle was exchanged
     for a 5 FR micropuncture sheath and inner dilator.  The inner dilator and
     guidewire were removed.  A .035 [**Last Name (un) 528**] wire was advanced through the
     micropuncture sheath into the axillary artery.  An exchange was then made for
     a 5 FR angiographic sheathr.  After the inner dilator was removed, the sheath
     was assembled to a continuous saline flush.  A 5 FR pigtail catheter was then
     advanced over the [**Last Name (un) 528**] wire into the ascending aorta.  The [**Last Name (un) 528**] wire was
     exchanged for a guidewire.  Using this combination, the catheter was advanced
     into the abdominal aorta.
     
     With the catheter positioned at the L1 vertebral level, an abdominal aortogram
     was performed.  This demonstrated patent renal arteries bilaterally.  The
     right limb of the aortobifemoral bypass graft was widely patent.  The left
     limb was occluded.  The native left common iliac was visualized but is
     severely diseased throughout.  The native SFA is occluded.  There is
     reconstitution of the profunda femoris artery.  The above knee popliteal
     artery is patent.  There is focal plaque present in the below knee popliteal
     artery.  At the level of the trifurcation, the anterior tibial artery is
     patent with mild stenosis proximally.  The peroneal and posterior tibial
     arteries are occluded.  The anterior tibial artery remains patent to the foot.
     There is a short focal occlusion of the dorsalis pedis artery.  There is
     retrograde filling of diseased plantar branches.  After the arteriogram was
                                                                 (Over)

     performed, a .035 [**Last Name (un) 528**] wire was advanced through the pigtail catheter.
     After the catheter was straightened, the guidewire and pigtail catheter were
     removed.  The patient was transferred to the recovery room where the 5 FR
     angiographic sheath was removed.  Manual pressure was held until hemostasis
     was achieved.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None.
     
     MEDICATIONS:  1% lidocaine.  0.5 mg of Versed and 50 mcg of Fentanyl were
     administered in intermittent doses with continuous monitoring of vital signs
     by the nursing staff.
     
     CONTRAST:  220 cc of Visipaque.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Abdominal angiography revealed an occluded left limb of the aortobifemoral
     bypass graft.  The right limb is patent.
     
     2.  Left lower extremity arteriography revealed a present but severely
     diseased native common iliac artery.  There is reconstitution of the profunda
     femoris.  The superficial femoral artery is occluded but there is
     reconstitution of the above knee popliteal artery.  There is focal stenosis
     present in the below knee popliteal.  At the level of the trifurcation, there
     is a single vessel runoff via the anterior tibial artery with mild stenosis
     proximally.  There is a short focal occlusion of the dorsalis pedis artery.
     There was retrograde filling of diseased plantar branches.

     rather blunted waveform at the right ankle with further diminishment of
     waveform quality at the metatarsal level bilaterally.  There is 2 mm of
     deflection at the right metatarsal and 5 mm at the left.  Ankle brachial
     indices were calculated on the right.  Its value was 0.44 and on the left,
     0.53.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Significant bilateral lower extremity arterial occlusive disease, right
     greater than left.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  80-year-old woman with left foot infection requiring long-term IV
     antibiotics.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2166**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 340**] and [**Doctor Last Name 603**], with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 603**], the Attending
     Radiologist, being present and supervising.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  The left upper arm was prepped and draped in the standard sterile
     fashion.  Since no suitable superficial veins were visible, ultrasound was
     used for localization of a suitable vein.  The basilic vein was patent and
     compressible.  After local anesthesia of approximately 4 cc of 1% lidocaine,
     the basilic vein was entered under ultrasonographic guidance with a 21- gauge
     needle.  A 0.018 guidewire was advanced under fluoroscopy into the superior
     vena cava.  Based on the markers of the guidewire, it was determined that the
     length of 40 cm would be suitable.  The PICC line was trimmed to length and
     advanced over a 4-French introducer sheath, and then fluoroscopic guidance
     into the superior vena cava.  The sheath was removed. The cannula was flushed.
     The final chest x-ray was obtained and showed the tip to be in the superior
     SVC. The line is ready for use.  A STAT-lock device was applied, and the line
     was HEP-blocked.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a 40 cm total length PICC line with the
     tip in the superior vena cava, ready for use.
