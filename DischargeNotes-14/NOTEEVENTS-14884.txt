Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was taken to the operating room and underwent an 
exploratory laparotomy, lysis of adhesions (extensive), 
resection of former ileocolonic anastomosis, re-do ileocolonic 
anastomosis and repair of recurrent ventral hernia. She 
tolerated this procedure well. Postoperatively, the patient was 
held in the PACU overnight due to low urine output, for which 
she received several fluid boluses. Pain was well-controlled 
with epidural anesthesia. On POD#2, the patient began to move 
bowels, and was given a house diet. On POD#3, following a 
diaphoretic episode coupled with bloody bowel movements, mild 
hypotension and tachycardia, the patient was found to have a 
hematocrit of 23. The patient was transfused 2 units of PRBC's, 
and a post-transfusion hematocrit was 30. From POD#4 to POD#6, 
the patient continued to experience bloody bowel movements and 
was again found to have a hematocrit of 22. She was transfused a 
total of 8 units of PRBC's and 4 units of FFP. On POD#6, the 
patient became acutely short of breath with an episode of rapid 
atrial fibrillation andhypotension. The patient responded well 
to lasix, oxygen and IV beta-blocker. The patient was 
transferred to the SICU for appropriate montioring. On POD#7, 
the patient had stabilized and was transferred back to the 
floor. The patient's hematocrit and vital signs remained stable 
throughout the remainder of her hospital stay and the patient 
was discharged home on POD#9 in stable condition

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY: 65-year-old woman with Crohn's disease, status post ileocolectomy.
     Needs blood transfusion and long-term intravenous access.
     
     PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 214**], [**Name5 (PTitle) 249**] and
     [**Name5 (PTitle) 603**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 603**], the attending radiologist, was present and supervising.
     
     The right upper arm was prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion. Since
     a suitable superficial vein was not visible, ultrasound was used for
     localization. The right bracheal vein was identified, patent and compressible.
     After local anesthesia with approximately 5 cc of 1% lidocaine, the right
     brachial vein was entered under ultrasonographic guidance with a 21 gauge
     puncture needle. A .018 guide wire was then advanced under fluorscopic
     guidance into the superior vena cava. Based on the markers on the guide wire,
     it was determined that a total length of 38 cm would be suitable. The
     micropuncture needle was then removed. A 4 Fr sheath with inner dilator was
     inserted into the vein. The inner dilator was removed and the PICC line was
     advanced over a wire to lie within the SVC. The sheath was removed. The
     catheter was flushed. A final chest x-ray was obtained. The film demonstrated
     the tip to be within the superior vena cava, just above the atrium. A StatLock
     was applied and the line was heplocked.
     
     CONTRAST/MEDICATIONS: ___ cc of 1% lidocaine for local anesthesia. 5 cc of
     nonionic Optiray contrast was injected into and near the vein for
     localization.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: None.
     
     IMPRESSION: Successful placement of a dual-lumen 4 Fr 38 cm in total length
     PICC via the right brachial vein with tip within the distal SVC. The line is
     ready for immediate use.

     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Line placement. 
     
     Compared to previous study of one day earlier.
     
     A right internal jugular vascular catheter has been placed, terminating in the
     superior vena cava.  A PICC line is unchanged in position.  Cardiac and
     mediastinal contours are stable.  There remains evidence of congestive heart
     failure with interstitial edema.  This is slightly improved in the interval.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Slight improvement in interstitial edema.
     
     Right internal jugular vascular catheter in satisfactory position with no
     pneumothorax.
