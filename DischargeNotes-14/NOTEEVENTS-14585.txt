Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1979**] 
Chief Complaint:
diarrhea, failure to thrive
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC placement
 
History of Present Illness:
40 yoM w/ h/o AIDS (CD4 [**11-1**] 45, VL 33k) on salvage HAART 
presents with 2 mos of diarrhea, weight loss. He returned from 
[**Country 3137**] following a family visit and saw his PCP (Dr. 
[**Last Name (STitle) **]/ID+Internal medicine at [**Hospital 10122**] Community Health Center)on 
[**3293-3-4**] c/o diarrhea and bloating. Stool studies were sent, 
notable for (+) cryptosporidium parvum oocytes. On [**3293-3-12**] he 
was prescribed nitazoxanide (500 mg PO twice a day) along with 
immodium. He noted no improvement in symptoms, progressive 
lethargy, and a slow decline in weight. He saw GI [**3293-4-8**], who 
ordered repeat stool studies (negative except for 
cryptosporidium), TTG (negative), and planned colonoscopy and 
EGD. On [**3293-5-6**], his PCP prescribed him [**Name9 (PRE) 10902**] (750 mg PO 
TID), azithromycin 500 mg PO daily for a planned 6 week course 
as an alterantive treatment for cryptosporidium. He underwent an 
EGD and colonscopy on [**3293-5-12**]. The EGD showed white plaques in 
the esophagus c/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 929**], antral erythema c/w gastritis, and 
vascualar congestion in the first and second part of the 
duodenum; duodenal and gastric biopsies were taken. Colonoscopy 
showed diffuse congestion of the whole colon; biopsies were 
taken from the colon (random), and terminal ileum. Given 
progressive weight loss (106 lbs -> 75 lbs), poor PO intake and 
refractory hypokalemia, pt is being admitted for PICC placement 
and initiation of TPN.  
.  
He reports that he has ~ 6 watery BM/day, large volume, 
occurring after each meal and [**1-30**] overnight. No fecal 
incontinence. (+) occasional ""specks of red,"" no melena. (+) 
bloating, worse with food intake, but no abdominal pain. Poor PO 
intake secondary to early satiety/bloating. (+) nausea without 
vomiting. No fevers, chills, or night sweats.  
.  
ROS: (+) ""thrush"" in mouth X several weeks; (+) occasional 
odynophagia. No headache, change in vision, stiff neck, chest 
pain, SOB, dysuria, hematuria, increased urinary 
frequency/urgency. No recent sick contacts (+) generalized 
weakness, no numbness/tingling  
 
Past Medical History:
1) HIV/AIDS: diagnosed 1994  
- currently on salvage HAART Kaletra/Trizivir/Viread; CD4 [**11-1**] 
45; VL [**3-2**] 33k

Pathology
[**5-12**] terminal ileum bx/duodenal bx: GS 1+ PMN, GPC pairs, 1+ 
GNR; cx pending, AFB smear (-), AFB cx pending, histology 
consistent with cryptosporidiosis with 1 cell suspicious for 
CMV, although staining negative. Duodenal biopsy culture showed 
Strep viridins and S. bovis. Ileum biopsy grew GNR, 
enterococcus, bacteriodes fragilis, and strep viridans

[**3293-5-20**] TTE: LVEF >55%, trivial MR, 2+ TR, borderline pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension, trivial/physiologic pericardial 
effusion.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
40 yoM w/ AIDS presents with 2 months of diarrhea, persistent on 
treatment for cryptosporidium, progressive weight loss.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) Hypokalemia: The patient's potassium has been chronically low 
as an outpatient, believed secondary to chronic diarrhea. On 
admission, K was <1.5 with bicarbonate 13. EKG demonstrated mild 
QT prolongation with ST depressions in V2-V5. He had no 
neuromuscular abnormalites noted on exam. He was placed on 
telemetry and transferred to the medical ICU for closer 
monitoring. There, his potassium was aggressively repleted. The 
renal service was consulted, who, given his negative urine anion 
gap, felt his non-anion gap metabolic acidosis and profound 
hypokalemia were consistent with GI loss rather than RTA. Once 
his potassium was adequately repleted, he was transferred back 
to the general floor on [**3293-5-15**]. Following transfer, he 
continued to require aggressive K repletion (both in IV fluids 
and TPN). His potassium will need to continue to be closely 
monitored as an outpatient to ensure stability.

2) Chronic diarrhea: most likely related to crytposporidium, 
which can take a long time to clear, particularly in AIDS 
patients. He has had an extensive prior work-up, including C. 
diff X2, Microsporidia X 3, Cyclospa X 3, O&P X 2, Giardia X 2, 
and fecal cx, all of which were negative. He was patient was 
continued on paromomycin and azithromycin for a planned 6 week 
course to treat cryptosporidium. His terminal ileum/transverse 
colon/duodenum biopsy viral cultures were negative at time of 
discharge. His histology from ileum/duodenum biopsies from [**5-12**] 
colonoscopy/endoscopy was consistent with cryptosporidiosis with 
1 cell suspicious for CMV, although staining was negative. A CMV 
viral load was obtained, which was pending at time of discharge. 
His primary care physician/ID will follow-up this result; if 
positive, the patient will need an ophthalmology exam. The 
patient was continued on tincture of opium and imodium for 
symptomatic relief.

3) Malnutrition: Most likely related to combination of chronic 
diarrhea, poor PO intake, and AIDS. Nutrition was consulted, and 
a PICC line was placed (tip in adequate position) for TPN. The 
patient was continued on a lactose-restricted regular diet with 
nutrition supplementations. He will continue on TPN as an 
outpatient until he has gained weight and is able to adequately 
nourish himself by mouth. 

4) Sinus tachycardia: The patient was noted to be in sinus 
tachycardia, with heart rates ranging from 100-140. This was 
felt to most likely represent volume depletion (given continued 
large volume diarrhea). He was aggressively hydrate with some 
improvement, however, at discharge, his heart rate remained 
110-120. He should be boluses with saline as needed for heart 
rates >120. A transthoracic echocardiogram was obtained on the 
day of discharge, which showed LVEF >55%, trivial MR, 2+ TR, 
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, and a 
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

5) Abnormal thyroid function tests: The patient's TSH was 
elevated at 4, with a mildly depressed free T4 at 0.7. Given 
patient's ongoing diarrhea and tachycardia, thyroid replacement 
was not initiated. He should have repeat thyroid function tests 
obtained 6 weeks following discharge. 

6) HIV/AIDS: CD4 45 [**11-1**], VL 33 [**3-2**]; [**3293-5-13**] CD4 17. 
Initially, the patient was continued on his home HAART regimen 
(Kaletra/Trizivir/Viread). This was discontinued on [**3293-5-17**] 
given it was felt to be exacerbating his diarrhea and causing 
the patient nausea/poor appetite. These will be resumed at the 
discretion of the patient's primary care physician. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] planned 
""med holiday"" is at least 2 weeks. The patient was maintained on 
bactrim DS prophylaxis throughout his hospital stay. 

7) Esophageal candidiasis: The patient was started on a 14 day 
course of fluconazole 100 mg PO daily given [**5-12**] endoscopy 
suggested esophageal candidiasis.

8) Urinary tract infection: Given positive urinalysis, the 
patient completed a 3 day course of levofloxacin for presumed 
urinary tract infection.
   
9) Anemia: On [**3293-5-19**], the patient's hematocrit was Hct 23 down 
from a baseline of 27. Iron studies were consistent with anemia 
of chronic disease, and vitamin B12/folate was elevated. He was 
guaiac negative without evidence of GI bleed. FDP, PT/PTT, and 
fibrinogen were normal, not consistent with DIC (although 
D-dimer was elevated). His haptoglobin was <20, suggesting a 
component of hemolysis. The etiology of this is unclear, as 
peripheral smear showed occasional schistocytes as well as 
occasional spherocytes. His direct and indirect combs tests were 
negative. The patient's likely has multifactorial bone marrow 
suppression in the setting of AIDS, HAART therapy (now 
discontinued), and malnutrition. He received 1 unit of PRBC on 
[**3293-5-19**]. At time of discharge, his hematocrit is 24.2. His 
hematocrit should be monitored 2-3 times a week to ensure 
stability, with a goal hematocrit >21.

10) Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelets ranged 38-73 
throughout his hospital course (baseline 84-152). Given normal 
FDP/fibrinogen/PT/PTT not consistent with DIC (see above) and 
negative HIT antibody, this was felt to most likely represent 
myelosuppresion in the setting of malnutrition, HAART (now 
discontinued). At time of discharge, the patient's platelet 
count is 73.

     ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND:  The liver parenchyma is normal in echotexture.  A few
     scattered areas of increased echogenicity near the right liver dome likely
     represent biliary hamartomas.  No focal nodules or masses are detected.  There
     is no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.  A moderate amount of sludge is
     seen within a non-distended gallbladder.  The gallbladder wall is slightly
     thickened at 3 mm.  The common bile duct dilated at 8 mm.  The right kidney
     measures 9.3 cm.  The left kidney measures 8.9 cm.  A 10 x 6 x 8 mm cyst is
     seen within the interpolar, lateral left kidney.  No hydronephrosis, stones,
     masses are seen bilaterally.  The spleen is not enlarged at 9.0 cm.  The
     pancreas and aorta are poorly visualized secondary to overlying bowel gas.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Minimal thickened gallbladder wall with intraluminal sludge and
     slightly dilated common bile duct.  These constellation of findings are
     concerning for HIV cholangiopathy.

     FINDINGS:  Right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed on [**3293-7-17**].
     Comparison made to prior study dated [**3293-7-10**].
     
     The hepatic parenchymal echotexture is within normal limits.  No focal hepatic
     lesions are identified.  There is no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
     The common bile duct is dilated, measuring up to 10 mm, and tapering in the
     pancreatic head.  No pancreatic masses are identified.  There is marked
     gallbladder wall thickening, measuring up to 11 mm in thickness.  No
     gallstones are identified.  Degree of gallbladder wall thickening is increased
     compared to prior study, although this could be secondary to decreased
     gallbladder distension.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation and markedly thickened
     gallbladder wall.  The combination of findings is concerning for HIV
     cholangiopathy, given the patient's clinical history:
