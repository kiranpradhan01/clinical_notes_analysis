Admission Date:  [**2563-4-28**]       Discharge Date:  [**2563-5-3**]

Service:  C-MED

ADDENDUM:  The patient is an 86-year-old gentleman with
gastric lymphoma sent here for cardiac cath from an outside
hospital.  The results of the cardiac catheterization showed
that in a right dominant system, the left main had some
luminal irregularities.  The LAD artery had mild diffuse in a
proximal vessel.  There was discrete 95% stenosis involving
the bifurcation of the mid-LAD and a large diagonal branch.
The left circumflex artery had discrete 80% stenosis in the
proximal vessel.  The right coronary artery was not
selectively engaged, as diagnostic catheterization the day
prior had shown it to have occlusive diffuse disease
proximally.  The stenosis at the bifurcation of the twin LAD
system was successfully treated by angioplasty and stenting
using a 3x13 mm drug-eluting Cypher stent positioned in the
large diagonal branch.  Final angiography revealed no
residual stenosis in the diagonal stent, occlusion of the
jailed LAD septal branch, and no angiographic evidence of
dissection.  The proximal left circumflex stenosis was
successfully treated by stenting.  The patient tolerated the
procedure well.

During the rest of the hospital course, the patient had no
episodes of chest pain or shortness of breath. The patient's
vitals were stable.  The patient's most recent hematocrit was
34, calculated status post transfusion of 1 unit of blood.
He had a crit of 28.7; therefore, he was transfused 1 unit.
His potassium was a little low at 3.4 and he was given 40 PO
potassium.  The patient's platelets were stable in the
mid-80s.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      86 year old man with CHF, s/p MI                                                
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      eval CHF

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Status post MI, question failure.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Single portable AP view of the chest without comparison.
     
     FINDINGS: The cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal.  The
     mediastinum is unremarkable.  There are bilateral moderate pleural effusions.
     There is perihilar haziness and mild pulmonary vascular redistribution, with
     several [**Last Name (un) **]-B lines.  There is a right-sided IJ catheter, terminating in
     the mid-SVC.  No pneumothorax.  There is retrocardiac opacity.  There is a
     mild dextroscoliosis of the upper lumbar spine.  The osseous structures are
     unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION: CHF, as evidenced by perihilar haziness, pleural effusion, and
     interstitial thickening.  Retrocardiac opacity may represent collapse or
     consolidation.
