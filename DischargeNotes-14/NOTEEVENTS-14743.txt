Admission Date:  [**3451-8-25**]       Discharge Date:  [**3451-8-28**]

Date of Birth:   [**3372-2-5**]       Sex:  F

Service:  VASCULAR SURGERY

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Asymptomatic right carotid artery stenosis.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 79-year-old
nondiabetic white female with CAD, cardiac dysrhythmia,
hypertension, severe COPD, oxygen-dependent for approximately
one year, who was noted to have carotid bruits several years
ago with noninvasive studies indicating no significant
stenosis on the right side and 60-79% stenosis on the left.
Recent follow-up carotid noninvasives showed the right side
90-99% stenosis on the right.  The patient denied any history
of TIAs or dizziness.

The patient was seen by her pulmonologist, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], prior to carotid surgery.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] was concerned
that the patient was at increased risk for complications
secondary to her pulmonary disease which might result in need
for mechanical ventilation with difficulty in weaning.  The
patient was given a course of steroids which was tapered
prior to surgery in order to maximize her pulmonary function.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  CAD.
2.  Cardiac dysrhythmia:  Treated with Norpace and
Persantine.
3.  Severe air-flow obstruction with chronic respiratory
failure, both hypoxemic and hypercarbic.  FEV1/FVC ratio
equals 47% in [**3451-6-22**].
4.  GERD.
5.  Large hiatal hernia.
6.  Upper GI bleed times two while on aspirin.
7.  Pneumonia one to two years ago at [**Hospital3 6628**].
8.  Arthrosis.
9.  Osteoarthritis.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Cholecystectomy in [**3396**].
2.  Hysterectomy in [**3421**].
3.  Cataract extraction O.S. in [**3445**].

ALLERGIES:
1.  Codeine causes chest pain and arm pain.
2.  Aspirin contributed to two recent upper GI bleeds.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Disopyramide 150 mg p.o. q. six hours.
2.  Accupril 10 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Nexium 40 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Oruvail 150 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Multivitamin one p.o. q.d.
7.  Combivent inhaler two puffs q.i.d.
8.  Prednisone taper.
9.  Darvocet p.r.n. pain.
10. Cyclobenzaprine p.r.n.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Father died at age 64 with Alzheimer's
disease.  Mother died at age 71 secondary to kidney cancer.
One brother had esophageal cancer.  One sister died of
Berylliosis.  Five children in good health.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a widow.  She lives alone and
is independent, using her oxygen as needed.  She quit smoking
cigarettes in [**3430-10-22**] after smoking one pack per day
for 39 years.  The patient's husband was a two pack per day
cigarette smoker until his death.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Pulse 102,
blood pressure 155/74, 02 saturation on 2 liters 02 equals
93%.  Height 5' 2"", weight 130 pounds.  General:  Alert,
cooperative white female in no acute distress.  HEENT:
Normocephalic.  Pupils equal and reactive to light.  Sclerae
anicteric.  Neck:  Range of motion within normal limits.  No
lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.  Carotids:  Palpable with
bruits, right greater than left.  No JVD.  Chest:  Increased
A/P diameter with kyphosis.  Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm
with occasional extra beat.  There was a II/VI systolic
ejection murmur.  Lungs:  Clear bilaterally.  Abdomen:  Soft,
nontender, no masses.  No hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities:
Warm.  No cyanosis, clubbing, or edema.  Pedal pulses were 2+
bilaterally.  Neurologic:  Nonfocal.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  On admission, hematocrit 41.2,
platelets 521,000.  PT 12.6, PTT 22.3, INR 1.1.  Sodium 145,
potassium 4.4, BUN 33, creatinine 1.0, glucose 60.

Chest x-ray showed no acute pulmonary disease, large hiatal
hernia present.  Khyphosis of the thoracic spine with
multiple compression deformities.

EKG on [**3451-8-20**] showed a sinus rhythm at a rate of 95 with
supraventricular extrasystole.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the hospital on
[**3451-8-26**] following an uneventful right carotid
endarterectomy.  At the end of surgery, the patient was
neurologically intact.

Immediately following surgery, the patient's systolic blood
pressure was maintained at greater than 120 with a
Neo-Synephrine drip.  The Neo-Synephrine drip could not be
weaned readily and the patient was transferred to the SICU
for further treatment.

The patient received Kefzol perioperatively.

On postoperative day number two, the patient developed EKG
changes which were concerning for a possible LAD lesion.  The
Cardiology Service recommended a cardiac catheterization as
soon as possible.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1476**] suggested waiting two to
three weeks postoperatively would decrease the risk of the
patient developing a neck hematoma.  The Cardiology Service
agreed to medically manage the patient since her cardiac
isoenzymes were flat.  Disopyramide was resumed.  The patient
refused cardiac catheterization.

The patient developed a rapid atrial fibrillation with a
ventricular response of 160.  She was anticoagulated with
heparin.  She converted to normal sinus rhythm with IV
Lopressor.  Disopyramide was resumed.  Valsartan 80 mg p.o.
q.d. was started.

The patient was transfused 1 unit of packed red blood cells
on [**3451-8-28**] for a hematocrit of 28.  The patient's post
transfusion hematocrit was 31.

At the time of discharge, the patient's neck incision was
clean, dry, and intact.  The patient was neurologically
intact.  She was instructed to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1476**] in
one week for staple removal from her incision.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  The patient was to resume all her preadmission
medications.
2.  Hydrochlorothiazide was increased from 12.5 mg to 25 mg
p.o. q.d.
3.  Accupril was increased from 10 mg to 20 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Valsartan 80 mg p.o. q.d.

DISPOSITION:   Home.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Satisfactory.

PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Asymptomatic right carotid artery stenosis.
2.  Right carotid endarterectomy on [**3451-8-25**].

SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Postoperative hypotension treated with Neo-Synephrine
drip:  Resolved.
2.  Blood loss anemia; status post transfusion of 1 unit of
packed rd blood cells.
3.  Rapid atrial fibrillation:  Resolved after treatment with
IV Lopressor.
4.  Coronary artery disease:  Possible left anterior
descending lesion.  Cardiac catheterization recommended, but
declined by patient.

     AP upright view is compared to PA & lateral views dated [**8-20**]. There is a
     new right middle lobe opacity, the extent of which is difficult to assess due
     to the overlying large hiatal hernia. Heart and mediastinum are unchanged.
     There is no congestive heart failure or pleural effusion. Surgical clips are
     present in the right neck. Kyphoscoliosis and associated rib cage deformity is
     once again noted.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1) Right middle lobe opacity consistent with atelectasis or
     pneumonia. A lateral view would be helpful if clinically feasible.
     
     2) Stable large hiatal hernia.
     
     3) Stable kyphoscoliosis.
