Addendum:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 10624**] coumadin was adjusted to 2.5 mg daily based on his 
hospital INR levels. He needs his INR followed. His atenolol was 
changed to low dose lopressor for heart rate parameters. He has 
renal insufficiency at baseline. His pre-op hctz is being 
started at 1/2 dose (12.5 daily) on discharge. It needs to be 
increased to 25 mg daily if his creatinine remains stable. Today 
he is being discharged to rehab with INR 2.1, tolerating regular 
diet, with clean incisions, and ambulation. He needs rehab for 
physical therapy.

     Portable supine chest, [**2943-3-8**].
     
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Status post coronary artery bypass surgery.
     
     There has been interval median sternotomy, aortic valve replacement, and
     coronary artery bypass surgery.  An endotracheal tube, Swan-Ganz catheter, and
     left-sided chest tube are in satisfactory position.  A nasogastric tube
     terminates at the thoracoabdominal junction with the side port above the GE
     junction level by several centimeters.  There is postoperative widening of the
     cardiac and mediastinal contours.  There has been interval development of
     perihilar and interstitial edema.  Bibasilar atelectatic changes are also new
     in the interval.  Small pleural effusions are seen bilaterally superimposed
     upon preexisting calcified pleural plaques.  No pneumothorax is evident on the
     supine study.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1)  Proximal location of nasogastric tube side port for which advancement is
     suggested for more optimal placement.
     
     2)  Interstitial pulmonary edema, bibasilar atelectasis, and small bilateral
     pleural effusions.
