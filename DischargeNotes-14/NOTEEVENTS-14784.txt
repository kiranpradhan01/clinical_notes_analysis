                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: 83-year-old male with acute lower GI bleed. The patient had a
     history of coronary artery disease, hypertension and dementia.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 346**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **].  The Attending Radiologist,
     Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], was present and supervising the entire procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE: The right groin was prepped and draped in sterile
     fashion, and access was gained into the right femoral artery using a 19 gauge
     single-wall needle. The 5 Fr sheath was then advanced and a sidearm flush
     attached. The superior mesenteric artery was then selectively catheterized
     using a 5 Fr C2 glidecatheter. Several superior mesenteric arteriograms were
     then performed.
     
     Several attempts were then made to selectively cannulate the inferior
     mesenteric artery but were unsuccessful. Therefore a 4 Fr Omniflush catheter
     was placed in the infrarenal abdominal aorta, and multiple PA and oblique
     aortograms were obtained in attempt to visualize the inferior mesenteric
     artery and its vessels. Following this, the catheter and sheath were removed,
     and compression was applied over the right groin until hemostasis was
     achieved.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: None.
     
     FINDINGS: The aorta and iliac vessels are extremely calcified. There is
     evidence for a replaced or accessory right hepatic artery, which has a focal
     stenosis at its origin. There is no evidence for active extravasation or
     vascular malformation involving the superior mesenteric vessels. Infrarenal
     abdominal aortograms demonstrate patency of the inferior mesenteric artery
     with a concentrically irregular appearance proximally. There is a large vessel
     rising from a branch of the inferior mesenteric artery, which courses
     superiorly, parallel to the aorta and supplies what appears to be transverse
     colon. However, no extravasation was identified. The inferior mesenteric
     artery appears overall vasoconstricted. Contrast is visualized in the bladder.
     No active extravasation is visualized involving the superior rectal artery.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     The common and external iliac arteries have the appearance of arteria magna.
     Both superficial and deep femoral arteries are patent bilaterally.
     
     IMPRESSION: Selective superior mesenteric arteriogram shows no evidence for
     active extravasation. Selective cannulation of the inferior mesenteric artery
     was not possible, most likely due to a severe osteal stenosis. However,
     infrarenal abdominal aortograms showed patency of the inferior mesenteric
     artery, without evidence for active extravasation. Findings reviewed with
     house staff during and after the procedure. Contrast was 200 cc of Optiray
     60%.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Recurrent lower GI bleeding.  The patient is status post
     mesenteric angiogram approximately 12 hours previously.  A blood cell
     scintogram was performed subsequently, demonstrating increased radio tracer
     uptake in the region of the mid-transverse colon.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 346**], the Attending Radiologist, who was
     present and supervising the entire procedure.
     
     CONTRAST/MEDICATIONS:  Versed and Fentanyl in divided doses.  120 ml of
     Optiray-320 6%.
     
     PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:  The procedure was described to the patient's
     daughter and informed consent was obtained.  Access was gained into the right
     femoral artery using a 19-gauge single wall needle.  A 5-French sheath was
     then placed.  A 5-French C2 glide catheter was used to access the superior
     mesenteric artery, and an angiogram was performed.  This demonstrated a
     replaced right hepatic artery, with an overall appearance of vaso constriction
     of the vessels supplying the bowel.  No active extravasation was demonstrated.
      The angiogram was performed with a different obliquity, again demonstrating
     no evidence for active extravasation.  Contrast refluxed into the aorta, and
     the left renal artery is incidentally noted.
     
     A third obliquity was then obtained, again without additional findings.
     
     The catheter was then advanced into the level of the celiac artery, and a
     common hepatic arteriogram was obtained.  This demonstrated a normal vascular
     appearance of the left hepatic artery, gastroduodenal artery, and pancreatic
     duodenal arcades.  No active extravasation was demonstrated.  Incidental note
     is made of a densely calcified splenic artery and superior mesenteric artery.
     
     The catheter was then pulled back to the level of the celiac trunk, and a
     celiac arteriogram was obtained.  This demonstrated disease of the splenic
     artery, with multifocal stenoses.  The left gastric artery appears normal.  No
     anatomic variants were demonstrated.
     
     A flush aortogram was then obtained with an Omni-Flush catheter placed at the
     level of the lower thoracic aorta. No anatomic variants were demonstrated.  An
     ulcerative plaque is visualized along the left lateral aspect of the aorta
     just inferior to the take-off of the left renal artery.  The inferior
     mesenteric artery again is patent, but no active extravasation is
                                                                 (Over)

     IMPRESSION:
     1.  No evidence for active extravasation at this time.
     2.  Replaced right hepatic artery arising from the superior mesenteric artery.
     3.  Extensive calcified aorto-iliac disease with arteria-magna of the iliac
     and femoral vessels.
     
     The findings were conveyed to the surgical house staff following the study.

     PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:  The procedure was described to the patient's
     daughter and informed consent was obtained.  Access was gained into the right
     femoral artery using a 19-gauge single wall needle.  A 5-French sheath was
     then placed.  A 5-French C2 glide catheter was used to access the superior
     mesenteric artery, and an angiogram was performed.  This demonstrated a
     replaced right hepatic artery, with an overall appearance of vaso constriction
     of the vessels supplying the bowel.  No active extravasation was demonstrated.
      The angiogram was performed with a different obliquity, again demonstrating
     no evidence for active extravasation.  Contrast refluxed into the aorta, and
     the left renal artery is incidentally noted.
     
     A third obliquity was then obtained, again without additional findings.
     
     The catheter was then advanced into the level of the celiac artery, and a
     common hepatic arteriogram was obtained.  This demonstrated a normal vascular
     appearance of the left hepatic artery, gastroduodenal artery, and pancreatic
     duodenal arcades.  No active extravasation was demonstrated.  Incidental note
     is made of a densely calcified splenic artery and superior mesenteric artery.
     
     The catheter was then pulled back to the level of the celiac trunk, and a
     celiac arteriogram was obtained.  This demonstrated disease of the splenic
     artery, with multifocal stenoses.  The left gastric artery appears normal.  No
     anatomic variants were demonstrated.
     
     A flush aortogram was then obtained with an Omni-Flush catheter placed at the
     level of the lower thoracic aorta. No anatomic variants were demonstrated.  An
     ulcerative plaque is visualized along the left lateral aspect of the aorta
     just inferior to the take-off of the left renal artery.  The inferior
     mesenteric artery again is patent, but no active extravasation is
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Recurrent lower GI bleeding.  The patient is status post
     mesenteric angiogram approximately 12 hours previously.  A blood cell
     scintogram was performed subsequently, demonstrating increased radio tracer
     uptake in the region of the mid-transverse colon.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 346**], the Attending Radiologist, who was
     present and supervising the entire procedure.
     
     CONTRAST/MEDICATIONS:  Versed and Fentanyl in divided doses.  120 ml of
     Optiray-320 6%.
     
     PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:  The procedure was described to the patient's
     daughter and informed consent was obtained.  Access was gained into the right
     femoral artery using a 19-gauge single wall needle.  A 5-French sheath was
     then placed.  A 5-French C2 glide catheter was used to access the superior
     mesenteric artery, and an angiogram was performed.  This demonstrated a
     replaced right hepatic artery, with an overall appearance of vaso constriction
     of the vessels supplying the bowel.  No active extravasation was demonstrated.
      The angiogram was performed with a different obliquity, again demonstrating
     no evidence for active extravasation.  Contrast refluxed into the aorta, and
     the left renal artery is incidentally noted.
     
     A third obliquity was then obtained, again without additional findings.
     
     The catheter was then advanced into the level of the celiac artery, and a
     common hepatic arteriogram was obtained.  This demonstrated a normal vascular
     appearance of the left hepatic artery, gastroduodenal artery, and pancreatic
     duodenal arcades.  No active extravasation was demonstrated.  Incidental note
     is made of a densely calcified splenic artery and superior mesenteric artery.
     
     The catheter was then pulled back to the level of the celiac trunk, and a
     celiac arteriogram was obtained.  This demonstrated disease of the splenic
     artery, with multifocal stenoses.  The left gastric artery appears normal.  No
     anatomic variants were demonstrated.
     
     A flush aortogram was then obtained with an Omni-Flush catheter placed at the
     level of the lower thoracic aorta. No anatomic variants were demonstrated.  An
     ulcerative plaque is visualized along the left lateral aspect of the aorta
     just inferior to the take-off of the left renal artery.  The inferior
     mesenteric artery again is patent, but no active extravasation is
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: 83-year-old male with acute lower GI bleed. The patient had a
     history of coronary artery disease, hypertension and dementia.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 346**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **].  The Attending Radiologist,
     Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], was present and supervising the entire procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE: The right groin was prepped and draped in sterile
     fashion, and access was gained into the right femoral artery using a 19 gauge
     single-wall needle. The 5 Fr sheath was then advanced and a sidearm flush
     attached. The superior mesenteric artery was then selectively catheterized
     using a 5 Fr C2 glidecatheter. Several superior mesenteric arteriograms were
     then performed.
     
     Several attempts were then made to selectively cannulate the inferior
     mesenteric artery but were unsuccessful. Therefore a 4 Fr Omniflush catheter
     was placed in the infrarenal abdominal aorta, and multiple PA and oblique
     aortograms were obtained in attempt to visualize the inferior mesenteric
     artery and its vessels. Following this, the catheter and sheath were removed,
     and compression was applied over the right groin until hemostasis was
     achieved.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: None.
     
     FINDINGS: The aorta and iliac vessels are extremely calcified. There is
     evidence for a replaced or accessory right hepatic artery, which has a focal
     stenosis at its origin. There is no evidence for active extravasation or
     vascular malformation involving the superior mesenteric vessels. Infrarenal
     abdominal aortograms demonstrate patency of the inferior mesenteric artery
     with a concentrically irregular appearance proximally. There is a large vessel
     rising from a branch of the inferior mesenteric artery, which courses
     superiorly, parallel to the aorta and supplies what appears to be transverse
     colon. However, no extravasation was identified. The inferior mesenteric
     artery appears overall vasoconstricted. Contrast is visualized in the bladder.
     No active extravasation is visualized involving the superior rectal artery.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     The common and external iliac arteries have the appearance of arteria magna.
     Both superficial and deep femoral arteries are patent bilaterally.
     
     IMPRESSION: Selective superior mesenteric arteriogram shows no evidence for
     active extravasation. Selective cannulation of the inferior mesenteric artery
     was not possible, most likely due to a severe osteal stenosis. However,
     infrarenal abdominal aortograms showed patency of the inferior mesenteric
     artery, without evidence for active extravasation. Findings reviewed with
     house staff during and after the procedure. Contrast was 200 cc of Optiray
     60%.

     (Cont)
     The common and external iliac arteries have the appearance of arteria magna.
     Both superficial and deep femoral arteries are patent bilaterally.
     
     IMPRESSION: Selective superior mesenteric arteriogram shows no evidence for
     active extravasation. Selective cannulation of the inferior mesenteric artery
     was not possible, most likely due to a severe osteal stenosis. However,
     infrarenal abdominal aortograms showed patency of the inferior mesenteric
     artery, without evidence for active extravasation. Findings reviewed with
     house staff during and after the procedure. Contrast was 200 cc of Optiray
     60%.

NPN 2100-0900:
NEURO: Pt has been intermittently agitated all night. He is generally completely disoriented, not answering questions though occasionally will tell [**Doctor First Name **] he is in the hospital). His agitation seems non-purposeful, in that he thrashes side to side, moans, calls for ""mama"", attempts to sit up, etc, but has not actively tried to pull anything out (though leads are frequently removed). He was treated with Versed 1mg several times late evening, with only transient sedation. Each time he seemed to wake up more agitated than before. At 0330 he was given 1mg IV Ativan with excellent effect for about 2 hours. He was given another 1mg at 0530, but only became more agitated. (At the time he appeared to be in respiratory distress, though he had already been diuresed, and it was hard to tell whether resp distress was causing the agitation or vice versa). He eventually appeared to wear himself out and settled down till 0730, when he recieved another 1mg Ativan, with good effect. [**Last Name (LF) 629**], [**First Name3 (LF) 34**]. 
RESP: Pt on 2L NC all night with sats in mid 90's. RR persistently high 20's-low 30's, increasing with agitation. By 0200 he appeared to have increased WOB, and crackles were heard on lung exam. He was given 40mg IV Lasix with resulting diuresis of >2L. However, although the crackles cleared, his resp status did not really seem any better, and (as above) he looked worse this morning. ABG showed pO2 62, and his O2 was increased to 4L; sats increased to high 90's. CXR done after diuresis; results pending. 
C-V: Pt has had problems with hypertension and tachycardia most of the night. CVP 9-15. EKG largely unchanged from admission. He has been treated with IV Lopressor (standing doses), IV Hydralazine, diuresis, and sedation with only transient effect. Ca repleted overnight; K+ 3.1 this AM; awaiting bag from pharmacy. 
GI: Belly soft, ND. Non-tender to palpation most of night, but appeared somewhat tender this AM when he was more agitated. KUB done; results pending. He has completed Golytely prep as of 0800 (done slowly to prevent vomitting). Stool was maroon in color during the evening, but has now progressed to liquid green not yet clear). Right groin site had slight bleeding during the evening, but none since MN. Pulses are palpable on left leg, dopplerable on right (unchanged). Knee immobilizer D/C'd at 0100, and pneumoboots placed at 0800. 
HEME: Has now recieved a total of 10U PRBC's with Hct up to 37 this AM. Coags normal, plt's drifting down. 
ENDO: Has not required any insulin. 
GU: Recieving scheduled doses of Mucomyst; U/O acceptable all evening, brisk since Lasix dose. 
ID: Afebrile, WBC 17K (up from 13k last night). No obvious source. 
ACCESS: PIV X 2, Cordis, A-line.  
SKIN: Pt has developed a slight macular rash over trunk and LE's, ? drug reaction. He also appears flushed in absence of fever. 
SOCIAL: no calls/visits overnight. 
 
A: Bleeding has resolved, but problems with increased agitation, hypertension and tachycardia.

HEME: No evidence of GIB today c bilious colored liquid stool output via mushroom catheter and stable serial HCT's noted (37.5 @ 12:00).  Coag times also WNL c an INR value of 1.3 @ 12:00.  Plt count currently stable @ 112 (also @ 12:00).  Pt currently has a large bore R IJ cortis in place in case the pt suddenly requires a trauma line.  Next HCT due @ 19:00.  HCT goal of > 28 noted, will cont to check HCT Q6 hours.

GI: As noted above, no GIB thus far today.  Pt started on his 2nd four liter bottle of Go-Lytely per team request for bowel prep/colonoscopy. However, the GI service just called to schedule his colonoscopy for Monday and therefore per team will d/c the Go-Lytely bowel prep for today and re-start Saturday evening.  Pt has normal bowel sounds and a soft abdomen.  1500ml bilious stool output today since MN.

CV: Pt in Afib c a HR in the 110-140 range this AM c occasional PVC's. Pt subsequently started on an Esmolol gtt and currently infusing @ 50mcg/kg/min via cortis c good rate cntl (HR in the 90-110 range).  Pt also appears to have less ventricular ectopy on Esmolol gtt.  Will cont to keep SBP in the 140-170 range.  Palpable LE pulses.  Afebrile. R A-Line c optimally dampened waveform.  AM hypokalemia repleted this AM, repeat K value @ 12:00 = 4.1.  AM CXR s evidence of CHF, holding additional IV Lasix @ this time.  AM EKG s new changes.  [**6-13**] Echo results include; dialated LA, LVH, nl EF (50-60%), RV dialation, +2 TR.

MS: Pt noted to be mumbling incoherently, attempting to get OOB and not able to follow commands/answer simple questions.  Pt subsequently med c a total of 4mg IV Lorazepam and 3mg IV Verced between 10:00 and 14:00 c good cntl of agitation.  Pt currently sedated but can easily be aroused in which he returns to his pre-sedated agitated state.  Pt agitation noted to increase his hyperdynamic state.  Pt currently in 2 point restraints c soft wrist restraints in place.  Per team, will attempt to lighten sedation as tol by pt.  However, pt still at risk for re-bleeding which can certainly be potentiated by abnormally elevated VS. 

RESP: Pt received on 4LNCO2 c sats generally in the mid 90's today and a RR in the 20-30 range.  Pt sat noted to drop to the low 90's s/p iv sedation.  ABG drawn/sent @ 13:00 c the following values; 7.38-45-61.  Pt subsequently provided c a PRN Albuterol neb followed by a 50% hi-flow Venti-Mask and HOB raised to 30% angle.  Pt sat much improved c values in the 97-99 range.  Pt RR presently in the high 20's.  LS are clear in the upper lobes and diminished in the lower lobes (poor resp effort) c coarse bs appreciated in upper airway (NTS applied c minimal success).  Will cont to follow sats/RR closely, send repeat ABG as needed.  

GU: Pt c over 3.0 liters UO today s/p 40mg IV Lasix during PM shift.  Pt considered for additional IV Lasix held 2nd no evidence of CHF on CXR.  Pt is currently + 6.0 liters input since admit, his I&O's for today are essentially equal.  Urine is clear and yellow incolorat

NPN 1900-0700:
NEURO: During the evening pt was slightly restless, arousable, not opening eyes or responding verbally except moaning. He became very agitated late evening, and was given 5mg Zyprexa with no response, followed by total of 2mg MSO4 IV, still with no response. He was then given 100mg PO Trazadone, after which he bcame progressively less responsive. Eventually unresponsive to all stimuli, including NTS, peripheral ABG, turning, and sternal rub. Gag was absent, cough impaired. He has since become slightly more responsive, with better cough. Of note, Haldol has been avoided d/t documented allergy. However, we have been unable to ascertain the nature of the allergy; his daughter [**Name (NI) 963**] does not know, and is trying to reach her sister who is on vacation in CA. I spoke to the nurse [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 6494**] Healthcare, the LTC facility he has been at for the past 4 weeks; she confirmed the documentation of the allergy in their records, and located a D/C summary from [**Hospital3 **] which also stated this allergy. She was unable to find any reference to the nature of the pt's reaction. Pt has also recently been at [**Doctor First Name 6495**] hospital, [**Hospital1 **], and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 150**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] NH in [**Location (un) **], though I am unsure of how recent these admissions were. 
RESP: Increasing O2 requirements during the evening; ultimately on 95% HFN with sats in mid 90's. He had some wheezing early evening which resolved with albuterol neb. He later developed crackles t/o lung fields, and a CXR showed some degree of CHF; given 40mg IV Lasix with U/o of about 900cc's. His resp distress continued to worsen, and he was given 80 mg Lasix, but with no response (foley irrigated easily). Of note, pt was relatively hypotensive at the time. He also developed very significant thick, tan, foul-smelling secretions, with very decreased BS on entire right side; he was suctioned q1 hour for several hours. ABG at 0330 was 7.26/57/130; at 0500 ABG was 7.27/55/97 (both drawn on 95% HFN). By early AM his sats were low 90's on the HFN, with RR 30's and significant distress. His HR had increased to 140's sustained; when this was brought under better control his resp status improved. 
C-V: Esmolol gtt initially decreased to 75mcg/kg/min; later in evening, wiht incraesed agitation, HR increased as well, and gtt was put back to 100mcg/kg/min. He was stable on that dose for several hours, but BP fell early morning, and esmolol was turned off for several hours. Eventually his HR climbed in to the 140's, sustained (bursts as high as 160), with a better BP, and the gtt was restarted at 50mcg/kg/hr with excellent effect. Currently HR is in the low 100's, with BP 90's/30's (MAP ~60). Of note, BP's are via NBP cuff; when he had an A-line earlier in the shift his A-line read higher. K+ WNL this AM; Ca was 6.7 and was repleted with 2 amps CaGlu. Right femoral angio site is slightly edematous with slight sero-sanguinous drainage. Area is a bit more mottled than before, including penis. Feet are warm with dopplerable pulses.

p last evening, afebrile now. WBC has climbed to 21.5K, with his lungs being the presumed source. A sputum spec was sent. 
GI: Minimal liquid golden OB+ stool via mushroom catheter. Belly benign. 
HEME: Hct, plts and coags all stable; no evidence of further bleeding. 
ENDO: Sugars stable without insulin.
SKIN: Possible rash from last night appears resolved. He has a [**2-14**]-inch skin tear on right wrist that was covered with Tegaderm. Skin otherwise intact.
ACCESS: With agitation, he lost his A-line and one PIV. He still has the Cordis and 2 PIV's. 

A: probable new pnx, possible CHF, tachycardia, relative hypotension, as well as ongoing mental status issues.

P: Monitor resp status; pulmonary hygeine; ? start IVAB. Keep NPO except meds; anticipate colonoscopy Monday (bowel prep Sunday). Monitor for further bleeding. Titrate esmolol for HR low 100's; follow BP closely. Replete lytes prn. F/U with other facilities regading question of Haldol allergy. Keep family informed and supported.
