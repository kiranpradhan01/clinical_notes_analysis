Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 10957**] was admitted on [**2777-12-13**] for scheduled open total 
colectomy and ventral hernia repair with mesh, see Op note for 
details. He was transferred to PACU post-op and was extubated. 
He recovered well and was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 455**] 9. 
.
Abdomen: POD #1 Abdominal binder was in place with clean dry 
dressings intact. An intact JP #1 drained adequate output from 
the RLQ and JP #2 drained serosainguinous fluid from the LLQ. 
The incision remained well approximated with staples and no 
drainage. NGT was in place post-op, and removed on POD#1. Flatus 
was noted on POD #4. Bowel movement occurred on POD#5. JP #1 was 
removed on POD #6. POD#8, first small loose bowel movement. 
Frequent loose stools developed over the next 24 hours, he was 
treated with immodium prn with fair results. On POD #8, NGT was 
reinserted due to development of ileus, when 1000 cc of green 
drainage was rapidly evacuated. C. Diff was negative x3. He was 
held NPO, and KUB obtained, see pertinent results. 
On POD #13, NGT was removed, patient tolerated well. Bowel 
function resumed on POD#13 with Staples were removed on POD#12, 
incision remained C/D/I, abdomen soft and nontender. JP #2 was 
removed on POD#15.
.
Pain: Epidural PCA was used with fair effect from HD#1 until POD 
#4. He was then transitioned to percocet po for pain control, 
with IV morphine injections for breakthrough pain until POD#7. 
Patient reported minimal post-op pain, and required no po 
narcotics after POD#8. 
.
Cardiovascular: Pt was stable in NSR until POD #5 when he 
developed atrial fibrillation. A cardiology consult was 
obtained. He was transferred to SICU for amiodarone drip. He 
converted to normal sinus rhythm, was transferred to CC6 and 
started on oral amiodarone. A TTE was performed, see pertinent 
results. He was monitored on telemetry, with intervals of afib, 
converting back to NSR over the next few POD days. He recieved 
lopressor IV until POD# 12, which he initially refused when he 
was immediately post-op. Coumadin was initiated and recommended 
by cardiology for 1 month. Amiodarone was continued po, and 
recommended for 3 months. He remained in NSR at the time of 
discharge.
.
Genitourinary: Foley catheter was in place until POD#7, when it 
was initially dc'd. The patient triggered on POD#7, related to 
low urine output of 45 cc over 4 hours. 
Foley was replaced, and output improved with fluid boluses. On 
POD#13, urine culture revealed pseudomonas, and cefipime IV was 
initiated, and continued at home after DC x 7 days total. Foley 
was left in place to leg bag for discharge home. 
.
Respiratory: Patient was on 2L nasal cannula O2 immediately 
post-op and weaned by POD#7. Upon development of ileus, O2 sats 
dropped and he was replaced on O2 4L to keep sats> 92%. On 
POD#10, patient was weaned to RA. 
.
Activity: Pt was up to the chair on POD#1 and ambulating halls 
POD#2. He remained active throughout his admission. 
.
Nutrition: TPN was started due to prolonged NPO status as a 
result of ileus. He recieved TPN from POD#10 until POD#12. His 
diet was advanced and he tolerated a regular diet on POD#13. 
.
He was discharged to home on POD#14 with appropriate follow up 
appointments and VNA service for IV antibiotics.
