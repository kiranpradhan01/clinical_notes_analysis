Admission Date:  [**3046-2-10**]       Discharge Date:  [**3046-2-21**]

Date of Birth:   [**2963-3-27**]       Sex:  M

Service:

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an
82-year-old male with known mitral valve disease and has been
experiencing increased shortness of breath for several months
and initially it was attributed to COPD; however, on repeat
echocardiogram which showed worsening MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] dilatation,
scheduled for cardiac catheterization and it showed LAD 80%
occluded, left circumflex 99% occluded, 3+ MR, and elevated
PA pressures.

The patient was initially admitted to the Medicine Service
for stabilization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  COPD.
2.  Mitral valve disease.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Pulmonary hypertension.
5.  Coronary artery disease.
6.  Status post MI in [**3018**].
7.  GERD.
8.  Cataract.
9.  Bladder cyst.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially admitted to the
Medicine Service and stabilized on the Medicine Service.  The
patient was taken by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] to the Operating Room on
[**3046-2-13**] and underwent a CABG times three, mitral
valve repair, and annuloplasty.

On postoperative day number one, the patient was admitted to
the DIC CRSU on an intra-aortic balloon pump and paralyzed
and sedated on Milrinone, Levophed, epinephrine, and
Pitressin.  The patient required multiple units of packed red
blood cells and FFP to maintain his cardiac index.

On postoperative day number one, the patient was started on
CVVH given his renal impairment and also given his fluid
overload.

The patient was transferred to the unit.  Postoperatively,
the chest was left open because difficulty ventilating the
patient because of COPD intraoperatively and at the time of
operation it was decided to leave the chest open.  The
patient was transferred to the CRSU with the chest open.  The
chest tube was clotted off postoperatively on postoperative
day number one and stopped draining.

The patient was becoming increasingly difficult to ventilate.
 The decision was made to re-explore and evacuate a hematoma
at the bedside on postoperative day number one for which the
procedure was carried out and the patient stabilized.  He was
continued on CVVH by the Renal service.

The patient was continued on the .................... stable
state for the next several days without any event.  He was on
CVVH on milrinone, epinephrine, Levophed, and was being
paralyzed and sedated for the next several days.

TPN was started on postoperative day number three.  On
postoperative day number five, we began to try some trophic
feeds; however, the patient did not tolerate trophic feeds.

On [**3046-2-20**], the patient's cardiac index appeared to be
deteriorating and the decision was made to re-explore the
chest again at the bedside.  The procedure was carried out;
1/2 liters of fluid was evacuated from the right pleural
space and some clots were evacuated from the chest tube.
However, since that day on the patient's condition began to
deteriorate rapidly and overnight the patient began to
require several amps of bicarbonate still having a pH of 7.21
on ABG.

Throughout the night of [**3046-2-20**], the patient continued
to require bicarb.  He went into A fib and was cardioverted
and went back into A fib again.

Eventually, on the morning of [**3046-2-21**], at approximately
6:30 a.m., the patient went into asystole.  Cardioversion was
carried out and several amps of bicarbonate and several amps
of calcium were given.  The epinephrine drip was turned up.
Milrinone was turned up to maximum.  Pitressin was turned up
to maximum, however, to no avail.

The patient expired on the morning of [**3046-2-21**] at
approximately 6:30 a.m.

DISCHARGE PROCEDURE:  Status post coronary artery bypass
graft, MVR and revision.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
2.  Mitral valve disease.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Pulmonary hypertension.
5.  Coronary artery disease.
6.  Status post myocardial infarction.
7.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
8.  Cataract.
9.  Bladder cyst.

     SINGLE VIEW CHEST:  Comparison is made to the prior study of [**3046-2-10**].  The right internal jugular catheter terminates in the lower SVC.  The
     NG tube extends into the stomach.  The endotracheal tube is approximately 4.5
     cm above the carina.  A pulmonary artery catheter is in appropriate position.
     There are also bilateral chest tubes.
     
     There is prominence of the cardiac and mediastinal contours, consistent with
     recent surgery.  There is an increase in the interstitial markings bilaterally
     which may relate to fluid overload.  No focal consolidations are identified.
     There are multiple linear densities overlying the manubrium of uncertain
     etiology.  Clinical correlation is suggested as this may represent a retained
     foreign body.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) Structure of uncertain etiology which overlies the area of the manubrium.
     This may represent a retained foreign body and clinical correlation is
     suggested.
     
     2) Postoperative changes as described.  Lines and tubes as above.

     PORTABLE SUPINE AP CHEST
     
     Comparison is made to [**3046-2-13**], 19:59. There is an ET tube 7 cm above the
     carina.  There is a right IJ catheter with tip in the region of the RV outflow
     tract/main pulmonary artery.  There are four chest/mediastinal tubes,
     unchanged in position.  There are curvilinear radiodensities overlying the
     thoracic inlet, unchanged.  These likely represent markers from sponges,
     and patient reportedly has an open chest wound.  At the left base laterally,
     there is a new rounded 7-8 cm opacity, just superior to the left chest tube.
     This could represent a focal fluid collection.  The remainder of the lungs are
     unchanged in appearance.

     lateral thorax is not completely imaged on this study.  There is an ET tube
     5 cm above the carina.  There is an IABP with radiopaque tip 3.3 cm below the
     top of the aortic knob, close to the aortic arch.  There are four
     chest/mediastinal tubes.  The curvilinear radiodensities seen at the midline
     of the thoracic inlet seen previously are no longer present and presumably
     represented sponges.  There are new clips overlying the mediastinum.  There is
     a right IJ PA catheter with tip in the region of the main pulmonary artery.
     
     The cardiac silhouette is stable.  The rounded density seen in the left mid to
     lower lung zone previously is again vaguely visualized, although the left
     hemithorax is not completely imaged.  There is prominence of the vasculature,
     which likely reflects edema, even given supine technique. There is atelectasis
     at both bases.

     placement.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Portable AP chest.
     
     COMPARISON: [**3046-2-15**]
     
     FINDINGS: There has been interval placement of a Dobbhoff tube which
     terminates within one of the right inferior bronchi.  The referring physicians
     were immediately contacted regarding this finding.  Four chest/mediastinal
     drains are present.  Surgical clips are seen around the mediastinum.  Cardiac
     and mediastinal contours appear grossly stable.  There is bibasilar
     atelectasis.  The previously described left basilar soft tissue opacity is
     again noted.  This could represent localized post operative fluid collection
     or hematoma.  Thre is continued perihilar haziness and blurring of vascular
     detail, consistent with mild congestive heart failure.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Placement of Dobbhoff tube within right bronchus.  Referring
     clinicians were contacted regarding this finding.

     now terminates within the main pulmonary artery. There is an intra-aortic
     balloon pump with its tip at the level of the carina. The cardiac and
     mediastinal contours appear stable. There is prominence of the pulmonary
     vasculature, indicating congestive heart failure. This appears worse in the
     interval. There has been an interval improvement in the left lower lobe patchy
     atelectasis. Please note that both costophrenic angles are excluded from this
     image.
     
     IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with worsened congestive heart failure.

CV:  NSR, changed to NST after dopa gtt started. No ectopy. Afebrile. Atial wires tested, capturing at lower ma now but would not work on a-side. V-wires present also.  Pacer turned off now. BP stable. Amiodarone, epi, levophed, vasopressin, milrinone gtts infusing and unchanged.  Started renal dose dopamine. CI >2 by fick.

PULM:  Mixed acidosis, increased resp rate. Became metabolic acidosis, tx with sodium bicarb and changes in CVVHD.  Suctioning nothing from ETT even with ambu/lavage. Diminished lung sounds throughout. CT's draining serosang fluid.

NEURO:  Fentanyl, Ativan, and cisatracurium gtts infusing. Get either 0/4 or [**3-20**] twitches, on left facial nerve.  No changes made in paralytic though because pt does not overbreath or move.  

GU:  Foley. Dopa gtt started at renal dose to try to improve UOP, very little increase seen.

GI:  No bowel sounds. High residual from TF, criticare at 10cc/hr. TF held for several hours and reglan given. TPN infusing.

SKIN:  Multiple blisters/burn areas on torso, left upper thigh and both antecubital areas from tape. Silvadene cream and telfa applied.  Air mattress on bed. Multi-podus boots on bilaterally. Hands elevated on pillows. Eye care done.

RENAL:  CVVHD active. Pt fluid removal rate changed during night with renal fellow, Dr.[**Last Name (un) 6537**] permission, from 250cc to 200cc/hr in attempt to help acidosis.

PLAN: Decrease K in TPN due to high K levels overnight. Monitor BP. Monitor UOP with dopa gtt.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
              82 year old man s/p cabg x 3, pod#4, still intubated with iabp          
             as above    
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      s/p reop at bedside-r/o ptx

     PORTABLE CHEST, [**2-20**]:
     
     INDICATION:  Bedside procedure.  Clinical concern for pneumothorax.
     
     PORTABLE AP SUPINE CHEST:  ETT projects 5.8 cm above the carina.  IABP tip
     projects 5.2 cm from the aortic arch.  Swan-Ganz catheter projects in the main
     pulmonary artery.  There are two left-sided chest tubes and one right-sided
     chest tube noted.  The left costophrenic angle is not included on this exam,
     which limits sensitivity for detection of pneumothorax in the supine position.
     There is no evidence of pneumothorax on the right.  Vascular indistinctness
     in the perihilar location suggests an element of CHF.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No evidence of right pneumothorax.  Sensitivity for left
     pneumothorax is limited due to absence of the left costophrenic angle on this
     exam.  A small amount of CHF cannot be excluded on this supine film.

CV:  Afib.  Amiodarone bolus given followed by attempted cardioversion twice, converted to NSR briefly then back to Afib-done at 1915 and 1940.  Attempted to override pace unsuccessfully. Cardioversion attempted again at 2210 and immediately a-paced at high rate which did sense and capture correctly for approx 10 minutes then back into afib. Occassional PVC, multifocal. V-pacing wires present but not attached to pacer. A-wires attached to pacer in v-side due to high ma requirement when pt does capture, pacer turned off now. Vasopressin, Milrinone, Amiodarone gtts infusing unchanged.  Increasing levophed gtt requirements overnight due to hypotension.  Epi gtt increased recently due to low SvO2, lower CI, and hypotension after speaking with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. CI >2 by fick method. Became hypothermic after CVVHD restarted, now normal temp. IABP decreased to 1:2 due to afib.

PULM:  Vent settings unchanged.  Very diminished lung sounds thoughout. Ambu/lavage ETT, no sputum.  CT's draining serosang fluid. 

NEURO:  Ativan, fentanyl, and cisatracurium gtts infusing. 

GU:  Foley, brown urine with sediment/sludge, very minimal amounts.

GI:  Hypo bowel sounds present. TPN infusing. TF held all night due to reverse tberg. 

RENAL:  CVVHD restarted during evening.  Pt fluid removal rate increased once per request of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3534**], renal fellow. Metabolic acidosis. Pt has alternating bicarb gtt with NS for replacement fluid but has also required extra sodium bicarb pushes to help pH.  

SKIN:  Chest open, sanginous fluid underneath transparent dsg. Large burn/blistered area on left torso,left upper thigh, both antecubital areas from tape, covered with silvadene cream and telfa.  Airmattress. Multi-podus boots bilaterally. Unable to turn pt due to open chest. Arms elevated on pillows. 

PLAN:  Restart TF, monitor VS. Possibly  got to OR for debridement of chest wound.
