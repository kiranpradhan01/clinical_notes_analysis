     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      70 year old woman with bile duct stricture
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      70 yo with possible liver mass. ERCP done at OSH showing biliary stricture.
      Please do CTA of abd and chest. Triphasic CT of liver with thin cuts through
      the hilar area to assess for mass.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  ERCP performed at an outside hospital showed a bile duct
     stricture.  Assess for possible liver mass.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images were obtained through the abdomen prior to
     and following the administration of IV contrast, according to the liver CT
     angiogram protocol.  Delayed images through the abdomen and pelvis,
     multiplanar reformatted and 3D volume rendered images were also obtained.
     Nonionic IV contrast was administered secondary to the rapid rate of injection
     required for this study.
     
     COMPARISONS:  None.
     
     CT OF ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:  The imaged portions of the lung
     bases demonstrate mild dependent linear opacities, likely representing focal
     areas of atelectasis.  There are two radiopaque densities within the lumen of
     the stomach, likely representing recently ingested medication.  The early
     arterial phase images show asymmetric patchy enhancement of the liver
     parenchyma, with segmental increased enhancement of the left lobe.  The
     portovenous phase images show continued asymmetric enhancement, with markedly
     dilated intrahepatic ducts involving most of the left lobe.  There are at
     least two dilated right intrahepatic ducts.  Although these ducts appear to
     converge on a poorly circumscribed 3.2 x 2.9 cm enhancing, low-attenuation
     mass near the central left hepatic lobe.  Additionally, there are innumerable
     subcentimeter low-attenuation foci scattered throughout both hepatic lobes,
     many of which do not appear to represent dilated bile ducts.  Unfortunately,
     they are too small to further characterize on this exam.  The largest of these
     additional low-attenuation foci reside within segment 4B, and measures
     approximately 2.4 x 1.9 cm.  There is a simple appearing cyst within the
     hepatic dome.  No additional mass lesions are identified.  There are multiple
     enlarged lymph nodes in the region of the porta hepatis, measuring up to 2.3 x
     1.7 cm.  There are additional smaller perpancreatic, mesenteric and
     retroperitoneal lymph nodes, none of which meets the CT criteria for
     pathologic enlargement.  There is a trace amount of perihepatic ascites.
     
     The spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, kidneys, and unopacified loops of
     large/small bowel are unremarkable.  There is no free air within the abdomen.
     
     CT OF PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is a small amount of free fluid within
     the pelvis.  The rectum, unopacified distal loops of bowel, distal ureters,
                                                                 (Over)

     urinary bladder, uterus and adnexal regions are unremarkable.  Noted is a
     single coarse calcifications within the uterus.  there is no free air or
     lymphadenopathy.
     
     Bone windows show degenerative changes within the visualized spine, but no
     suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
     
     CT ANGIOGRAM:  The intraabdominal aorta and its major branches are widely
     patent.  The liver demonstrates conventional arterial supply.  The right and
     left hepatic arteries appear patent.  Likely secondary to the above described
     mass, most of the left portal vein (aside from its most central portion) and
     left hepatic vein are not visualized.  The middle hepatic vein is also poorly
     visualized.  The right hepatic vein, right portal and main portal veins appear
     patent.  The splenic vein is unremarkable.  The SMV is within normal limits.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1.  Findings worrisome for a 3.2 x 2.9 cm heterogeneous mass
     within the left hepatic lobe.  Its delayed enhancement, along with the
     significant associated biliary ductal dilatation, is suggestive of a
     cholangiocarcinoma.  Other primary hepatic neoplasms should be considered.
     
     2.  Additional low-attenuation foci scattered throughout both lobes of the
     liver, many of which are too small to further characterize, are worrisome for
     addtional foci of disease.  As discussed above, these foci do not have the
     appearance of intrahepatic biliary ducts and cannot be confidently
     characterized as simple hepatic cysts.  If indicated, further evaluation with
     a liver MRI may be helpful in the continued work up of this case.
     
     3.  Non-visualization of a majority of the left portal vein, as well as the
     left and middle hepatic veins.  These findings, coupled with the markedly
     asymmetric enhancement of the left hepatic lobe is worrisome for vascular
     involvement of this neoplastic process.
     
     4.  Perihepatic lymphadenopathy.
     
     5.  Small amounts of abdominal ascites.
     
     These findings and recommendations were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**3357-1-5**].

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  A 70-year-old female awaiting left hepatic lobectomy for
     suspected liver mass.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial CT imaging of the chest performed after the intravenous
     administration of 100 mL of Optiray.  Nonionic contrast was used due to
     patient debility.  Comparison is made to a prior CT of the abdomen performed
     on [**3357-1-5**].
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  A pericardial lymph node is seen above the
     diaphragm measuring 1.9 x 0.8 cm (series 2, image 30).  No pathologically
     enlarged axillary, hilar, or mediastinal lymph nodes are seen.  The airways
     are patent to the level of the segmental bronchi bilaterally.  A tiny 2-3 mm
     micronodule within the peripheral right upper lobe (series 3, image 34) and an
     additional 2-3 mm tiny nodule within the right lower lobe (series 3, image
     122) are identified.  Nodular opacities adjacent to the minor fissure (series
     3, image 83) and the major fissure (series 3, image 77) measuring less than 5
     mm are also seen.  No other definite nodules or areas of pulmonary parenchymal
     consolidation are seen.  No pleural effusion is identified.  Some bronchial
     wall thickening is seen within both lung bases.
     
     Within the visualized portions of the upper abdomen, there is evidence of
     slightly increased ascites when compared to the prior study of [**3357-1-5**].  As
     described on the prior abdominal CT, there is again seen a left-sided biliary
     ductal dilatation and scattered foci of low attenuation within the liver.
     
     Bone windows show no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1).  Tiny right upper lobe and right lower lobe nodules as well as several
     tiny foci of nodular thickening adjacent to the right major fissure and minor
     fissure. Although possibly due to noncalcified granulomas and/or
     intrapulmonary lymph nodes, a three- month followup CT is recommended to
     exclude early mets at these sites.
     
     2).  A 1.8 x 8 mm pericardial lymph node.
     
     3).  Slightly increased ascites when compared to [**3357-1-5**].

Admission Date: [**3357-1-31**]        Discharge Date: [**3357-2-9**]

Date of Birth:  [**3286-6-12**]        Sex:  F

Service:  HEPATOBILIARY SURGERY


This is a 70-year-old female who underwent an exploratory
laparotomy and a true-cut biopsy of the liver three times, a
wedge biopsy of the liver on [**3357-1-31**].  Her preoperative
diagnosis was a liver mass, probable pre-cholangic carcinoma,
left lobe intraductal dilatation. Intraoperatively she was
found to have poorly differentiated carcinoma of the liver.
Please see the operative note by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1695**] for further
information on the intraoperative course and procedure
details.

Postoperatively the patient was admitted for routine postop
care to the Surgical intensive care unit due to some low
urine output and volume hemodynamic instability.  Immediately
postop the patient had a PA catheter inserted and required
some Neo for blood pressure and hemodynamic control.

On postop day one the patient was continued on Neonephrine
and her fluid status was reassessed continually by being in
the Intensive care unit.  Her hydrochlorothiazide was
restarted.  Her crit remained stable and her blood pressure
continued to improve with a normal systolic in approximately
120.  She was afebrile with stable vital signs.  On postop
day two the patient was given chest PT and out of bed and
Neonephrine was started to be weaned to tolerate a systolic
blood pressure of 110.  Urine output remained a little bit
less but it remained well in the sense of 75 cc's an hour.

On postop day three Neo was down to 1.0.  The patient
remained afebrile but did intermittently have some low grade
temperature to 100.6.  Blood pressure remained well.
Occasional blood pressures lower than a systolic of 100 but
usually in the low 100's.  She remained stable.  Positive
urinalysis and Levaquin was started.  The patient remained on
the floor on [**3357-2-4**] due to bed status, was felt to be able
to be a good candidate to the floor.  On [**3357-2-5**] she
continued to have some decreased urine output over the
evening of the 11th and 12th and received some boluses.  Due
to the potential chance for increased fluid instability the
patient was kept in the Intensive care unit for further
management and hemodynamic monitoring.  On [**3357-2-5**] the
patient complained of intermittent shortness of breath and
with poor p.o. intake.  She remained afebrile with systolic
blood pressure in the 90 to 100's.  She was started on TPN
and p.o. Lasix.

On [**3357-2-6**] the patient was transferred from Intensive care
unit to the floor.  Was ideally negative two liters,
continued to have a pretty good stable blood pressure off any
pressors and did not require any.  On [**3357-2-7**] the patient did
well and had no problems however, the patient continued
monitoring her TPN, slowly started to be weaned to 1 liter on
the evening of the 14th.  It was discussed whether or not her
Foley should be discontinued but due to the fact that she was
not very mobile it was best to keep the Foley in place.  In
addition a Social Work meeting and case management
involvement, discussion with the family as well as the doctor
indicated that they would like to admit patient to Skilled
Nursing Facility for comfort measures.  She was in agreement
and an initial screen was placed on [**3357-2-7**].  On [**3357-2-7**] the
patient was made DNR/DNI.  The patient was screened on
[**3357-2-8**] and monitored.  As per the requested TPN was stopped.
Foley was kept and adjusted for comfort.  She continued to
diurese and was receiving 80 mg of Lasix p.o. twice a day on
the 15th but will be discharged on the 16th with 40 mg p.o.
twice a day.

The patient was discharged to an Extended Care Facility for
comfort measures.  She is to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1695**] in
approximately one week to remove her staples.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Status post exploratory laparotomy and biopsy on [**3357-1-31**].
2. Left hepatic duct stricture.
3. Hypertension.
4. Postoperative hypotension.


CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. once daily
2. Lenazapril  30 mg p.o. once daily
3. Dilaudid 2 mg p.o. q two hours p.r.n.
4. Colace 100 mg tablet p.o. twice a day.
5. Midodrine 2.5 mg p.o. three times a day.
6. Albuterol inhaler q six hours p.r.n.
7. Spironolactone 100 mg p.o. once daily.
8. Ipratropium bromide nebulizer q 6 hours p.r.n.
9. Ativan 0.5 mg p.o. three times a day p.r.n.
10.      Lasix 40 mg p.o. twice a day.
11.      Insulin as per sliding scale.

The patient will be discharged as indicated above to Extended
Care Facility.  Her anticipated day of discharge is [**3357-2-9**]
pending approval from the patient's family for the care
center that had accepted the patient.

     the interlobar portion of the right pulmonary artery.  There is no evidence of
     pneumothorax and previously noted left retrocardiac opacity has nearly
     resolved.  There has otherwise been no significant change since the recent
     study of the same date.
