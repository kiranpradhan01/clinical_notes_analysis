     EXAMINATION PERFORMED:  PA and lateral chest.
     
     INDICATION:  Coronary artery disease.
     
     PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained [**3370-8-10**].  No prior films are
     available for comparison.  There is mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
     consistent with cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion.  There is tortuosity
     of the thoracic aorta.  The lung fields show no evidence of acute infiltrate,
     pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The bony structures are unremarkable for
     the patient's age.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Mild cardiac enlargement.  No other convincing radiographic evidence of acute
     cardiopulmonary disease.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      64 year old man with 3VD for CABG                                               
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      stenosis?

                                     FINAL REPORT
     CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE.
     
     Preop CABG and vein mapping.
     
     FINDINGS:  Duplex evaluation was performed of both lower extremities.  The
     right greater saphenous vein is patent with diameters ranging from 0.19-0.38
     cm.  The right lesser saphenous vein is patent with diameters ranging from
     0.22-0.29 cm.
     
     The left greater saphenous vein is patent with diameters ranging from
     0.24-0.39 cm.  The left lesser saphenous vein is patent with diameters ranging
     from 0.20-0.29 cm.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Patent bilateral lesser and greater saphenous veins with
     diameters as noted.
     
     CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE:
     
     Duplex evaluation was performed of both carotid arteries.  Moderate plaques
     identified on the left.
     
     On the right, peak systolic velocities are 65, 62, 112 in the ICA, CCA, ECA
     respectively.  The ICA to CCA ratio is 1.  This is consistent with less than
     40% stenosis.
     
     On the left, peak systolic velocities are 120, 76, 123 in the ICA, CCA, ECA
     respectively.  The ICA to CCA ratio is 1.6.  This is consistent with a 40-59%
     stenosis although this will fall to lower end of the range.
     
     There is antegrade flow in both vertebral arteries.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Moderate left-sided plaque with a 40-59% carotid stenosis.  This
     will fall to the lower end of the range.  On the right, there is less than 40%
     stenosis.

     CMR Technical Information:
     Total Gd-DTPA (Magnevist ) contrast: 0 ml
     
     1) Structure: Axial dual-inversion T1-weighted images of the myocardium were
     obtained without spectral fat saturation pre-pulses.
     2) Function: Breath-hold cine SSFP images were acquired in the left
     ventricular 2-chamber, contiguous 4-chamber, horizontal long axis, contiguous
     short axis orientations, sagittal and coronal orientations of the left
     ventricular outflow tract, and aortic valve short axis orientations. Tagged C-
     SPAMM cine images were also obtained in the 4-chamber orientation.
     
     Findings:
     Structure and Function
     There was normal epicardial fat distribution. The myocardium appeared to have
     homogenous signal intensity without evidence of myocardial fatty infiltration.
      The pericardial thickness was normal without evidence of tethering on tagged
     images. There were no pericardial or pleural effusions. The origins of the
     left main and right coronary arteries were identified in their customary
     positions.  The indexed diameters of the ascending, arch, and descending
     thoracic aorta were normal.  The main pulmonary artery diameter index was also
     normal.  The left atrial AP dimension was mildly enlarged.  The right and left
     atrial lengths in the 4-chamber view were markedly enlarged.  The coronary
     sinus diameter was normal.
     The left ventricular end-diastolic dimension index was normal.  The end-
     diastolic volume index was normal.  The calculated left ventricular ejection
     fraction was normal at 67% with normal regional systolic function.  The left
     ventricular mass index was normal.  The right ventricular end-diastolic volume
     index was normal.  The calculated right ventricular ejection fraction was
     normal at 51%, with normal free wall motion.  A signal void was seen in the
     left atrium in systole, consistent with mitral regurgitation.
     Comparison of left- and right-sided stroke volume suggested no significant
     intracardiac shunt.
     No atrial septal defect was seen.
     The aortic valve was tri-leaflet with normal valve area.

     (Cont)
     Quantitative flow could not be performed because of the patient's baseline
     arrhythmia.
     
     Impression:
     
     1. No evidence of an atrial septal defect.
     2. Normal left ventricular cavity size with normal regional left ventricular
     systolic function.  The LVEF was normal at 67%.
     3.    Normal right ventricular cavity size and function. The RVEF was normal
     at 51%.
     
     4.    The indexed diameters of the ascending aorta, arch, and descending
     thoracic aorta were normal. The main pulmonary artery diameter index was
     normal.
     5.    Probable mitral regurgitation.
     6.    Biatrial enlargement
     
     The images were reviewed by Drs. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2935**] [**Last Name (LF) 7607**], [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10675**], and

     CMR Technical Information:
     Total Gd-DTPA (Magnevist ) contrast: 0 ml
     
     1) Structure: Axial dual-inversion T1-weighted images of the myocardium were
     obtained without spectral fat saturation pre-pulses.
     2) Function: Breath-hold cine SSFP images were acquired in the left
     ventricular 2-chamber, contiguous 4-chamber, horizontal long axis, contiguous
     short axis orientations, sagittal and coronal orientations of the left
     ventricular outflow tract, and aortic valve short axis orientations. Tagged C-
     SPAMM cine images were also obtained in the 4-chamber orientation.
     
     Findings:
     Structure and Function
     There was normal epicardial fat distribution. The myocardium appeared to have
     homogenous signal intensity without evidence of myocardial fatty infiltration.
      The pericardial thickness was normal without evidence of tethering on tagged
     images. There were no pericardial or pleural effusions. The origins of the
     left main and right coronary arteries were identified in their customary
     positions.  The indexed diameters of the ascending, arch, and descending
     thoracic aorta were normal.  The main pulmonary artery diameter index was also
     normal.  The left atrial AP dimension was mildly enlarged.  The right and left
     atrial lengths in the 4-chamber view were markedly enlarged.  The coronary
     sinus diameter was normal.
     The left ventricular end-diastolic dimension index was normal.  The end-
     diastolic volume index was normal.  The calculated left ventricular ejection
     fraction was normal at 67% with normal regional systolic function.  The left
     ventricular mass index was normal.  The right ventricular end-diastolic volume
     index was normal.  The calculated right ventricular ejection fraction was
     normal at 51%, with normal free wall motion.  A signal void was seen in the
     left atrium in systole, consistent with mitral regurgitation.
     Comparison of left- and right-sided stroke volume suggested no significant
     intracardiac shunt.
     No atrial septal defect was seen.
     The aortic valve was tri-leaflet with normal valve area.

moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis. There are simple 
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

Post-CPB: Good LV systolic fxn. Improved though still depressed 
RV systolic fxn with inotropes running. Mitral ring prosthesis

FINAL REPORT

 
INDICATION: 64-year-old man with change in mental status, _____ 
pupils 
following history of CABG, DIC. 
 
COMPARISON: CT head dated [**3370-9-12**]. 
 
TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT. 
 
FINDINGS: There has been interval development of a mass of 
predominantly left 
frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage. More diffusely, there are 
extensive 
areas of subarachnoid hemorrhage. There is global focal 
effacement and loss 
of [**Doctor Last Name 898**]-white differentiation. There is marked left to right 
subfalcine 
herniation. There is extensive uncal herniation as well as 
descending 
transtentorial herniation with inferior displacement of the 
third ventricle.  
There is displacement of the thalami and brain stem into the 
posterior fossa 
as well as bilateral tonsillar herniation into the cervical 
canal. A large 
amount of hemorrhage is also seen extending into the entire 
ventricular 
system. The visualized paranasal sinuses and osseous structures 
are 
unchanged. 
 
IMPRESSION: Interval development of massive left frontal 
intraparenchymal 
hemorrhage and diffuse areas of subarachnoid hemorrhage. This is 
associated 
with diffuse loss of [**Doctor Last Name 898**]-white differentiation, suggesting 
global hypoxia.  
Associated bilateral areas of herniation including tonsillar 
herniation are 
compatible with a grave prognosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**9-5**] and underwent cabg x4/cryo MAze/PFO closure/MV 
repair with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Transferred to the CSRU in stable condition on amiodarone, 
epinephrine, milrinone and propofol drips. Remained sedated and 
ventilated for several days as he developed hyperkalemia and 
renal failure. He continued to require pressor and inotropic 
support during these first few days. All lines were changed over 
the first weekend and he failed weaning from the ventilator. 
Enteral feedings were started and all sedation turned off on POD 
#5. Chest tubes were removed on POD #7. He continued to improve 
and was more awake. Antibiotic coverage continued empirically.He 
was extubated and had intermittent CPAP  for support.Creatinine 
continued to rise and he developed respiratory distress on [**9-17**] 
requiring re-intubation. His right lower leg began to become 
more edematous with the development of pain and passive 
dorsiflexion.
General surgery was consulted and took the patient emergently to 
the OR on [**9-18**] for a right LE fasciotomy for an apparent 
fasciitis.An exploratory lap was also done and a 
gastrojejunostomy tube was placed. Abdomen was not completely 
closed at that time.  Blood cultures were positive on [**9-18**] (POD 
# 13) for gram negative rods and Zosyn, ampiciliin and 
clindamycin were added for coverage. He continued to develop a 
floridly septic picture and HD was started for renal failure. He 
developed liver failure with rising LFTs and required 
cardioversion for not tolerating A Fib. Abx were changed per ID 
recommendations and vascular surgery was consulted to help 
evaluate his legs. Urosepsis and severe shock ensued over the 
next few days. Per ID consultation, xigris was started with 
known high risk, but other options very limited considering his 
grave prognosis. Pupils became non-reactive without corneal 
reflexes on the eve of POD #16.CT scan done on [**9-21**] showed a 
catastrophic cerebral bleed with compression of the brainstem 
per neurology consult. The family was informed of the extremely 
grave prognosis and they elected to withdraw care. The patient 
was removed from the ventilator and expired at 17:30 with his 
family present in the room.

      64 year old man with s/p cabg/MV with oliguria                                  
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      check renal flow

                                     FINAL REPORT
     PORTABLE RENAL ULTRASOUND AND RENAL DOPPLER
     
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Oliguria in a 64-year-old man status post CABG and
     mitral valve replacement, to check for hydronephrosis and renal flow.
     
     This is a portable study done at the bedside.  The left kidney measures 11.7
     cm in size and shows no evidence of hydronephrosis or stones.  Attempted color
     flow and pulse Doppler studies of the left kidney are completely inadequate
     for interpretation, probably due to body habitus.
     
     The right kidney measures 12.3 cm in length and again shows no evidence of
     hydronephrosis or stones.  Color flow and pulse Doppler in the right kidney
     does show some intrarenal flow, both arterial and venous, although the
     information is limited and the pulse Doppler waveforms are not interpretable
     due to respiratory motion.
     
     The bladder is empty.  On images 6 and 7, there is a contour bulge at the
     upper pole of the left kidney which cannot be accurately assessed again due to
     the limitations of the study.  It measures approximately 3 cm in diameter and
     requires further evaluation to assess for whether this is a cystic structure
     or solid nodule or merely a contour lobulation.
     
     CONCLUSION:  Technically limited study showing normal-sized kidneys with no
     hydronephrosis.  Doppler assessment is inadequate due to patient's size and
     respiratory motion.  There is a question of a 3-cm mass or cyst at the upper
     pole of the left kidney which cannot be adequately evaluated on this study and
     there are no prior images of the kidneys available.  This could be further
     evaluated with CT or MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 6540**] appropriate.

     The distal tip is in the proximal right main pulmonary artery.  The right
     internal jugular vascular sheath remains in place.  The remaining support
     tubes and lines are stable.  Noted is a small right pleural effusion and mild
     symmetric bilateral vascular congestion.  No frank edema is noted.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Newly placed left subclavian central venous sheath with
     indwelling Swan-Ganz catheter as above.  The right internal jugular approach
     Swan-Ganz catheter has been pulled with the sheath remaining in place.  No
     pneumothorax is seen.

     AP PORTABLE CHEST, [**3370-9-8**] AT 8:20 A.M.
     
     HISTORY:  Status post extensive cardiac surgery with new fever.
     
     COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, the most recent dated [**3370-9-7**].
     
     FINDINGS:  The patient is rotated to the right.  Within this limitation, there
     is relative increased opacification of the lower right hemithorax with
     obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm consistent with interval development of
     a posterior layering pleural effusion.  Support tubes and lines remain stable
     with the Swan-Ganz catheter distal tip again noted to be within the pulmonary
     venous outflow tract.  Retrocardiac opacity has minimally improved.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Interval development of right pleural effusion.
     
     2.  Stable support tubes and lines.

     Endotracheal tube terminates 5.5 cm above the carina.  A Swan-Ganz catheter
     terminates in the distal right pulmonary artery, and a nasogastric tube

     remain in place.  A new very small left apical pneumothorax is present, as
     well as subcutaneous emphysema in the left chest wall.
     
     Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  There is increasing vascular
     engorgement as well as perihilar haziness and worsening basilar opacities,
     likely due to pulmonary edema.  A component of atelectasis is also likely in

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HEAD CT
     
     HISTORY:  64-year-old male status post CABG, now with inability to move left
     upper extremity, assess for stroke.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous 5 mm axial images were obtained from the skull base to
     the vertex without IV contrast.
     
     FINDINGS:  No comparisons are available.
     
     There is no sign of intracranial hemorrhage. There are no masses or mass
     effect.  The [**Doctor Last Name 63**]/white matter differentiation is maintained.
     
     There is minimal periventricular cerebral white matter hypodensities, which
     likely represent chronic small vessel infarcts.
     
     There is a tiny area of hyperdensity along the sulci of the right frontal
     lobe, which may represent a vascular calcification.
     
     The ventricles, sulci, and basal cisterns are within normal limits.
     
     The visualized orbits are normal.
     
     There is air-fluid level within the right maxillary sinus which also contains
     a septation.  Air-fluid levels are also seen within the sphenoid sinuses
     bilaterally.  Endotracheal tube is in place.  There is minimal leftward
     deviation of the nasal septum.
     
     Fluid is seen within the nasopharynx.
     
     Fluid density material and/or mucosal thickening is seen within the mastoid
     air cells bilaterally.   Both the sinus findings and nasopharyngeal fluid
     likely relate to the intubated state of the patient.
     
     No focal bony abnormalities are seen.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial abnormalities.  If there is  clinical
     suspicion for acute brain ischemia, an MRI examination, with diffusion-
     weighted imaging is a more sensitive diagnostic study, as compared with the
     present non- contrast head CT scan.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     An endotracheal tube is in place, terminating at the thoracic inlet level,
     slightly greater than 6 cm above the carina.  A feeding tube coils within the
     cervical region, likely within the cervical esophagus.  Left subclavian
     vascular sheath is unchanged in position in the left brachiocephalic vein.  A
     right subclavian vascular catheter has been placed, terminating in the lower
     superior vena cava just above the junction with the right atrium.  Cardiac
     silhouette remains enlarged, and there is slight worsening of CHF with
     increasing perihilar haziness.  Moderate left effusion and left retrocardiac
     opacity are without change.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Malpositioned feeding tube as described, and as communicated by telephone

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  64-year-old man with change in mental status, _____ pupils
     following history of CABG, DIC.
     
     COMPARISON:  CT head dated [**3370-9-12**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT.
     
     FINDINGS:  There has been interval development of a mass of predominantly left
     frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage.  More diffusely, there are extensive
     areas of subarachnoid hemorrhage.  There is global focal effacement and loss
     of [**Doctor Last Name 63**]-white differentiation.  There is marked left to right subfalcine
     herniation.  There is extensive uncal herniation as well as descending
     transtentorial herniation with inferior displacement of the third ventricle. 
     There is displacement of the thalami and brain stem into the posterior fossa
     as well as bilateral tonsillar herniation into the cervical canal.  A large
     amount of hemorrhage is also seen extending into the entire ventricular
     system.  The visualized paranasal sinuses and osseous structures are
     unchanged.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Interval development of massive left frontal intraparenchymal
     hemorrhage and diffuse areas of subarachnoid hemorrhage.  This is associated
     with diffuse loss of [**Doctor Last Name 63**]-white differentiation, suggesting global hypoxia. 
     Associated bilateral areas of herniation including tonsillar herniation are
     compatible with a grave prognosis.
