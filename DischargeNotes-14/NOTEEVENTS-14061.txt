Brief Hospital Course:
85 year ld male with h/o CAD s/p CABG/PCI, CHF (EF 45%), DM2, 
HTN, PVD presents with ischemic ECG though no symptoms.

Cardiac:
Ischemia: ECG was concerning for active ischemia although no 
symptoms. was cathed and had balloon angioplasty of the first 
diagonal. started on aspirin, plavix, metoprolol, atorvastatin 
and valsartan. Atorvastatin was d/c'ed secondary to increaseing 
CPKs. No statin therapy was intiiated.
.
Pump: EF 45%. Echo shows mild regional left ventricular systolic 
dysfunction. Started on metoprolol and valsartan. had transient 
episodes of SBP in 80s and HR in 120s yesterday. resolved on 
itself. pt was asymptomatic
.
Rhythm: now in SR. h/o atrial tach was followed by Dr. 
[**Last Name (STitle) 396**]. Amio was started during recent hospitalization by EP 
consultants for SVT. was continued on amio. Pt had episode of 
narrow-complex tachycardia. Broken by carotid sinus massage. 
Differential was atrial tachycardia vs. AVNRT. Pt was loaded 
with digoxin.
.
DM2/hypoglycemia: was placed on RISS. HbA1c of 6.3. do not think 
he has DM. hence no antidiabetic meds started. Oral hypoglycemic 
agents and insulin were not used during the admission.
.
Foot ulcer: sees Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 895**] at [**Hospital1 **]. underwent ABI PVR. 
???????????
.
FEN: cardiac diet. 
.
Dementia: sedating meds avoided
.
Proph: was on sc heparin.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  85-year-old male acquiring IV access for antibiotics.  IV team
     was not able to advance a PICC line.
     
     PHYSICIANS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2926**].
     Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 553**] [**Name (STitle) 250**], the attending physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1636**] present and supervising the
     entire procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  The patient was brought to Radiology suite and placed
     supine on the angiography table.  Following a preprocedural timeout including
     the patient's name, and two patient identifiers, the right arm was sterilely
     prepped and draped.  As no suitable veins were visible, ultrasound was used to
     identify the right basilic vein, which was patent and compressible.
     Approximately 5 cc of 1% lidocaine were administered for local anesthesia.  A
     21-gauge needle was used to access the right basilic vein using
     ultrasonographic guidance. Hard copy ultrasound images were obtained before
     venipuncture. A 0.018-inch guidewire was then threaded through the needle and
     into the vein. The needle was then exchanged for a 4 French micropuncture
     sheath.  The guidewire was advanced into the SVC and based on the markings on
     the wire, a single lumen 4 French PICC line was trimmed to a length of 38 cm.
     The PICC was then advanced over the wire and into the SVC under fluoroscopic
     guidance. The wire and peel-away sheath were removed.  The catheter was
     flushed, capped, and heplocked. Finally, the catheter was StatLocked into
     placed and a sterile transparent dressing was applied.  A final fluoroscopic
     image was taken demonstrating the tip of the PICC at the caval atrial
     junction.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a 4 French single lumen 38 cm PICC by way
     of the right basilic vein with the tip located at the cavoatrial junction. The
     line is ready for use.

      85 year old man with needs long term antibiotics                                
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  85-year-old male acquiring IV access for antibiotics.  IV team
     was not able to advance a PICC line.
     
     PHYSICIANS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2926**].
     Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 553**] [**Name (STitle) 250**], the attending physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1636**] present and supervising the
     entire procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  The patient was brought to Radiology suite and placed
     supine on the angiography table.  Following a preprocedural timeout including
     the patient's name, and two patient identifiers, the right arm was sterilely
     prepped and draped.  As no suitable veins were visible, ultrasound was used to
     identify the right basilic vein, which was patent and compressible.
     Approximately 5 cc of 1% lidocaine were administered for local anesthesia.  A
     21-gauge needle was used to access the right basilic vein using
     ultrasonographic guidance. Hard copy ultrasound images were obtained before
     venipuncture. A 0.018-inch guidewire was then threaded through the needle and
     into the vein. The needle was then exchanged for a 4 French micropuncture
     sheath.  The guidewire was advanced into the SVC and based on the markings on
     the wire, a single lumen 4 French PICC line was trimmed to a length of 38 cm.
     The PICC was then advanced over the wire and into the SVC under fluoroscopic
     guidance. The wire and peel-away sheath were removed.  The catheter was
     flushed, capped, and heplocked. Finally, the catheter was StatLocked into
     placed and a sterile transparent dressing was applied.  A final fluoroscopic
     image was taken demonstrating the tip of the PICC at the caval atrial
     junction.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a 4 French single lumen 38 cm PICC by way
     of the right basilic vein with the tip located at the cavoatrial junction. The
     line is ready for use.

     INDICATION:  Bilateral leg and foot pain.  Previous TMA.  Please also look at
     the graft in the left leg.
     
     FINDINGS:  Doppler waveforms were monophasic in the right femoral and
     popliteal and dorsalis pedis arteries and absent in the posterior tibial.  On
     the left, the common femoral waveform was triphasic, with popliteal and
     dorsalis pedis waveforms monophasic and absent in the posterior tibial.
     
     Segmental limb pressures were progressively decreased in the right leg, with
     the right ABI 0.53.  On the left, pressure is also decreased progressively
     with a significant drop between the low thigh and calf, and a left ABI of
     0.47.
     
     Pulse volume recordings on the right show abnormal widening and flattening at
     all levels.  On the left, the lower thigh tracing is unremarkable, but at the
     left calf, left ankle and left metatarsal levels, there is widening and
     dampening, with essentially flat tracing at the left metatarsal level.  The
     distal tracings and amplitudes on the left at the ankle and metatarsal levels
     are distinctly worse than on the right.
     
     Evaluation of the left thigh demonstrated an occluded left superficial femoral
     artery.  No bypass graft was identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Aorto-right iliac disease and right tibial disease with right ABI
     in the moderate-to-severe ischemic range.
     
     Left SFA occlusion and left tibial disease with the left ABI within the severe

     HISTORY:  [**Age over 90 **]-year-old with bilateral leg and foot pain.  Right lower extremity
     graft.
     
     FINDINGS:  The patient has a right fem-to-tibial bypass graft.  Peak systolic
     velocities within native right common femoral artery 28 cm/sec and at the
     proximal graft anastomosis with this vessel, 35 cm/sec.  Graft velocities
     range from a maximum of 92 to a minimum of 45 cm/sec.  Though not well
     visualized, in the region of the distal graft anastomosis, the peak systolic
     velocity does reach 212 cm/sec.

     moderate to high-grade stenosis within the distal graft in the region of the
     distal anastomosis.
