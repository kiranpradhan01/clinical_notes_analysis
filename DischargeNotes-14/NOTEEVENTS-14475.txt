     INDICATION:  EVALUATE FOR VASCULAR ABDOMINAL AORTIC ANEURYSM REPAIR.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  A CT angiogram of the abdominal aorta was performed using a rapid
     bolus of IV contrast.  Precontrast and post-contrast images were obtained
     through the abdomen and pelvis.  Multiplanar reformations were performed.
     
     CONTRAST:  100 cc Optiray per CT angiogram protocol.  The patient developed a
     contrast allergy requiring intubation.
     
     CT ANGIOGRAM:
     
     The abdominal aorta is diffusely ectatic. There is a more focal area of
     aneurysmal dilatation of the infrarenal aorta measuring up to 3.9 cm in
     diameter and 4 cm in length.  The length from the renal arteries to the area
     of increased dilatation is 5.5 cm.  At the level of the renal arteries, the
     aorta measures 3.6 cm. 5 mm below the renal arteries, the aorta measures 3.8
     cm. 10 mm below the renal arteries, the aorta measures 3.9 cm. The aorta
     measures 3.7 cm 15 mm below the renal arteries. The AP angle of the aneurysm
     is 0 degrees. The lateral angle of the aneurysm is 130 degrees. There is no
     inferior neck.
     
     The right common iliac artery is moderately tortuous with a diameter of 1.1
     cm. The left common iliac artery is mildly tortuous with a diameter of 0.9 cm.
     The angle of the right common iliac artery to the aneurysm is 133 degrees. The
     angle of the left common iliac artery to the aneurysm is 151 degrees. Both
     external iliac arteries are mildly tortuous with moderate calcifications. Mild
     calcifications of the femoral arteries are identified.
     
     The celiac artery and SMA patent.  The [**Female First Name (un) **] is thrombosed.  There are single
     bilateral renal arteries which are patent.
     
     MULTIPLANAR REFORMATIONS: Images confirm findings are described above.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST:
     
     Scarring or atelectasis is identified at the left lung base.  The liver,
     spleen, adrenals, pancreas, and gallbladder are unremarkable.  The kidneys
     enhance promptly and symmetrically with no hydronephrosis or focal mass. The
     kidneys are lobulated. Small retroperitoneal nodes are identified. No ascites

     contrast-enhanced CT scan requiring intubation.
      
     DECISION:  Ventilation images were performed.   
      
     Ventilation images obtained with Tc-99m aerosol in 8 views demonstrate
     heterogeneous distribution consistent with route of administration. 
      
     Perfusion images in the same 8 views show slightly heterogeneous uptake in  a
     nonsegmental distribution.
      
     Chest x-ray shows asymmetric interstitial edema.
      
     The above findings are consistent with a low likelihood of pulmonary embolism.

PMICU Nursing Admission Note

Please see carevue for objective data. Pt. is a 72 year old woman admitted from CT s/p resp. arrest. Pt. was seen as an outpatient for abdominal CT with contrast to evaluate abdominal aortic aneurysm. Scan was completed and pt. came out of bathroom complaining of shortness of breath. Found to be bradycardic at 30, intubated emergently for respiratory distress and transported to MICU, initial ABG of 88/56/7.07. Cold and clammy with significant mottling of chest and lower extremities. Pt. in junctional rythmn of 35, B/P stable, but was treated with 1mg epi. Heart rate transiently up to the 80's...B/P transiently as high as 240/syst. Placed on rule out MI protocol ...given ASA, heparin bolus of 4200U and gtt started at 900U/hr, briefly on NTG gtt. Pt. also received ativan/MSO4 (see carevue) due to agitation, biting on ETT, etc.   Subsequently heart rate again dropped to the 30's and pt hypotensive to 70/.  Treated with 1mg atropine with HR in the 70's. Received 250cc NS fluid bolus (total of 1750cc) and was transiently started on dopamine.  Pt. being ruled out for an MI. EKG (old RBBB) without evidence of infarction per cardiology. Emergent ECHO showed diffuse hypokinesis with moderately decreased EF. LENI's negative for DVT. ?allergic reaction, ?PE, ?CVA.

HISTORY: hypercholesterolemia, hypertension

CNS: Pt. currently sedated with MSO4 .5mg/hr (very sensitive to any narcs, benzos).  Pt. does open eyes, wiggles toes to command. Soft wrist restraints applied. 

RESP: ABG's have improved to 145/29/7.48/22/0 on A/C 80% 600x16 with 5 of PEEP. Lungs with coarse BS throughout. Suctioned for scant amt. light yellow secretions. 

GI: OGT to LIS. Abdomen firm and distended upon admission. Much softer now, with active bowel sounds. 

ID: Afebrile, no antibiotics. 

RENAL: Foley catheter placed...autodiuresing clear yellow urine. 

ENDO: Blood sugar of 280, no treatment at this time. Repeat pending. 

SKIN: Intact, less mottling although still present. 

LINES: Right radial art line placed. Right IJ triple lumen placed...confirmed by CXR. 

HEME: Heparin gtt dc'ed at 1800 d/t PTT of 140.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      72 year old woman with hx of AAA was coded in CT on [**2987-8-14**] for respiratory
      failure.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      S/P code for respiratory failure, intubated.  Still hypotensive.  ? CHF

                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Respiratory failure.  Status post intubation.
     
     Comparison is made to previous study of 1 day earlier.
     
     Central venous catheter, nasogastric tube and endotracheal tube remain in
     satifactory position.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable in
     appearance.  Pulmonary vascularity remains indistinct with asymmetric
     perihilar haziness right greater than left, shows minimal interval
     improvement.
     
     No confluent areas of consolidation are observed in either lung.
     
     There is mild elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Slight improvement in findings suggestive of asymmetric pattern
     of congestive heart failure.  Underlying infections process in the right lung
     is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
