CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Admitted for plasmapheresis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known patient lastname 11204**] is a 78-year-old
woman with a history of plasmacytoma of her left anterior
third rib, status post radiation therapy one year prior, who
underwent a bone marrow biopsy on [**2963-9-4**] which
demonstrated increased plasma cells.  She was also noted to
have a creatinine of 2.6 from her baseline value of 0.5 to
0.8 and was admitted for further treatment with
plasmapheresis to hopefully prevent further kidney damage.

Of note, the patient had a recent non-Q-wave myocardial
infarction in [**2963-6-25**] at [**Hospital 508**] Hospital with positive
enzymes and electrocardiogram changes in the inferior and
lateral leads.  Post infarction, she had a stress test which
reportedly showed no reversible ischemia.  A transthoracic
echocardiogram at that time confirmed an ejection fraction of
55% to 60%.  She also has a history of some pulmonary edema.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Plasmacytoma of the left anterior third rib.
2.  Cerebrovascular accident in [**2957**].
3.  Anterior myocardial infarction in [**2963-6-25**].
4.  Congestive heart failure (with an echocardiogram
demonstrating an ejection fraction of 55% to 60%); presumed
diastolic dysfunction.  Left internal carotid artery stenosis
of 60% to 80%, right internal carotid artery stenosis high
grade.
5.  Hypercholesterolemia.
6.  Peripheral vascular disease.
7.  Fibromyalgia.
8.  Spinal stenosis; status post surgery.
9.  Corneal transplant.

ALLERGIES:  CIMETIDINE.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with her husband.  No
tobacco.  No alcohol.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Family history is notable for father with
diabetes and daughter with cancer of the lung.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
revealed temperature was 97.6, heart rate was 60, blood
pressure was 122/50, respiratory rate was 24, and oxygen
saturation was 97% on room air.  In general, awake and alert,
in no acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat
examination revealed left eye with corneal transplant.
Pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.  The
oropharynx with moist mucosal membranes.  The neck revealed
carotid bruits bilaterally.  No jugular venous distention.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and
rhythm.  A 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left upper
sternal border.  Pulmonary examination revealed crackles at
the left base.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and
nondistended.  No bruits.  No hepatosplenomegaly.  Normal
active bowel sounds.  Extremity examination revealed no
clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  Dorsalis pedis pulses were 2+
bilaterally.  Skin examination revealed no rashes.
Neurologic examination revealed alert and oriented times
three.  Sensory and motor examinations were grossly within
normal limits.  Cranial nerves II through XII were intact.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories
revealed white blood cell count was 8.2, hematocrit was 31.6,
and platelets were 311. Sodium was 140, potassium was 3.8,
chloride was 110, bicarbonate was 16, blood urea nitrogen was
60, creatinine was 2.4, and blood glucose was 98.  Urine
protein to creatine was 5.3.  Creatinine clearance was 18.
Albumin was 3.8.  Calcium was 9.4 and phosphate was 5.4.
Prothrombin time was 13.1, INR was 1.2, and partial
thromboplastin time was 21.9.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  Ms. [**Known patient lastname 11204**] was admitted
for plasmapheresis for treatment of her kidney myeloma.  The
patient was given gentle fluid hydration for her acute renal
failure.

The patient underwent plasmapheresis on [**11-10**].
Treatment with medfalan and prednisone for her myeloma was
planned.

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  On [**11-11**], the patient
developed her first episode of chest pain and shortness of
breath with electrocardiogram changes consistent with
ischemia.  Cardiac enzymes demonstrated a creatine kinase of
158 and a troponin of

     slight decrease in the diffuse bilateral alveolar pattern. This could reflect
     improved pulmonary edema or decreasing pulmonary hemorrhage given the history
     of blood per DDT.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: Recent coronary stenting, anticoagulation and dropping hematocrit.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiple axial images of the abdomen and pelvis without
     intravenous contrast.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  Bibasilar parenchymal
     densities are greater on the right.  Some adjacent ground glass opacities are
     present.  An NG tube passes into the stomach.  Artifact from coronary stents
     is present.  There is a Swan-Ganz catheter extending superiorly from the right
     groin.  Increased attenuation within the kidneys is consistent with some
     retained contrast; the left kidney is somewhat atrophic.  Multiple gallstones
     layer dependently within the gallbladder.  A tiny calcific density within the
     spleen is probably a granuloma.  There is diffuse calcification of the aorta
     and its visceral branches.  The liver, pancreas, and adrenal glands are
     normal.  No retroperitoneal hemorrhage or fluid collection is seen.  There is
     no intraabdominal fluid.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The small bowel opacifies
     normally.  A foley catheter is seen within the collapsed bladder.  The sigmoid
     colon contains several diverticulae.  The rectum and uterus are normal and
     there is no free fluid within the pelvis.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There is a laminectomy defect of the lower lumbar spine.  A
     well-corticated defect within the medial left iliac crest is consistent with
     bone marrow grafting donor site.
     
     IMPRESSION:  High attenuation bibasilar lung consolidations.  This could
     represent intraparenchymal hemorrhage or aspiration of hemorrhagic material.
     No retroperitoneal hemorrhage.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     Compared to previous study of four days earlier.
     
     CLINICAL INDICATION: Hemorrhagic aspiration. Decreased oxygen saturation.
     
     There has been interval extubation and removal of Swan-Ganz catheter and
     nasogastric tube.
     
     The heart is mildly enlarged, and there is vascular engorgement. Bilateral
     perihilar alveolar and hazy pattern of increased lung opacities shows slight
     interval improvement. There are small pleural effusions present.
     
     The skeletal structures reveal numerous compression deformities on the spine
     and an expansile lesion involving one of the upper left anterior ribs.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1. Interval extubation.
     
     2. Slight improvement in bilateral asymmetric perihilar alveolar pattern which
     is more severe on the right than the left. This may be due to asymmetric
     pulmonary edema, aspiration pneumonia, or pulmonary hemorrhage.
     
     3. Expansile left rib lesion and multiple compression deformities in the
     spine, which may be related to myeloma.

     Comparison to patient's prior chest x-ray at [**Hospital1 1937**] [**Location (un) 1948**] on [**2963-11-2**].
     
     The heart is enlarged without evidence of failure. There are no focal
     infiltrates.  There is slight blunting of the posterior costophrenic sulci,
     suggesting very small pleural effusions.  The large mass with bone destruction
     involving the left third rib is again noted, unchanged.  There are numerous
     compressed thoracic vertebral bodies.  There are no other significant
     findings.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Possibly very small pleural effusion since [**2963-11-2**].
     
     Otherwise, there is no change in the chest.

     CHEST
     
     HISTORY: COUGH
     
     The heart is enlarged. There are no signs of failure and there are no focal
     infiltrates. The large mass involving the left third rib is again noted
     measuring 5 cm in diameter. There is slight fullness of the left hilum raising
     a question of adenopathy in the AP window.  There are numerous compressed
     thoracic and lumbar vertebral bodies. There is no effusion.
     
     IMPRESSION: No change in the chest since [**2963-12-12**].
