Admission Date:  [**3205-10-5**]     Discharge Date:  [**3205-10-8**]

Date of Birth:   [**3137-4-3**]     Sex:  M

Service:  [**Location (un) 2089**]

ADDENDUM:

This is an addendum to the prior dictation summary starting
with hospital course.

The patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit
for management of hypotension, acute on chronic renal
insufficiency and hyperkalemia.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  In the medical Intensive Care Unit, the
patient ruled out for myocardial infarction by three sets of
cardiac enzymes.  Patient's blood pressure medications were
discontinued and patient maintained systolic blood pressures
in the 90s to 100s with normal saline boluses.  The patient
was maintained on Telemetry which demonstrated rate
controlled atrial fibrillation with occasional premature
ventricular contractions.  The patient's Amiodarone was held
for 24 hours without evidence of nonsustained ventricular
tachycardia.  Amiodarone was restarted on hospital day #2
without complication.

The patient's volume depletion was repleted with intravenous
fluids without signs of congestive heart failure.  The
patient was continued on aspirin and Lipitor per outpatient
regimen.  The patient was transferred to the floor on
hospital day #3 and restarted on half dose of his outpatient
Lopressor at 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d. with continued blood
pressures in the 120s to 130s over the 60s to 80s.  On
hospital day #4, the patient was restarted on his after load
reduction at a low dose of Zestril 10 mg p.o. q. day without
complication.  The patient's remains without signs or
symptoms of cardiac ischemia throughout the hospitalization.

2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  In the Medical Intensive Care Unit
the patient was treated presumptively for a urinary tract
infection with Ceftriaxone 1 gram q. 24 hours.  On previous
hospitalization, the patient was diagnosed with an E.coli
urinary tract infection sensitive to Ceftriaxone and
resistant to Ciprofloxacin as well as Levofloxacin.  The
patient was discharged to home on a course of Levofloxacin
prior to culture sensitivities.

The patient's urinary culture at the time of dictation
demonstrate greater than 100,000 gram negative rods
unspeciated with sensitivities pending.  Given the previously
untreated E.coli urinary tract infection, the patient was
continued on Ceftriaxone while awaiting sensitivities.  The
patient remained afebrile with a normal white blood cell
count throughout the hospitalization and demonstrated no
further signs of acute infection.

3.  RENAL:  Patient was admitted with an acute on chronic
renal insufficiency the etiology of which is likely
multifactorial secondary to an inadequately treated urinary
tract infection, hypotension in the setting of a recently
increased ACE inhibitor and decreased oral intact with
decreased total body intravascular volume.  The Renal Team
was consulted for recommendations.

The patient's creatinine progressively improved with
intravenous fluids, off the ACE inhibitor, Allopurinol and
Colchicine as well as diuretics.  The patient continued to
maintain excellent urine output throughout the
hospitalization.  The patient's ACE inhibitor was
reintroduced on hospital day #4 at a low dose to be titrated
as tolerated.

The patient was admitted with hyperkalemia which resolved
following the treatment in the Emergency Department.  The
hyperkalemia was without recurrence while the patient was off
Aldactone and Ace inhibitor.

4.  GI:  Patient has a history of chronic abdominal pain of
unknown etiology.  The patient's abdominal pain was unchanged
in quality or severity during the hospitalization and the
patient was without evidence of liver function tests or
pancreatic enzyme abnormality.  The patient tolerated oral
intake without worsening of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting
or diarrhea and constipation.

5.  HEMATOLOGY:  Patient was admitted on Coumadin for atrial
fibrillation status post multiple cerebrovascular accidents.
The patient's Coumadin was continued during the
hospitalization and held on hospital day #3 secondary to a
supratherapeutic INR of 5.3.  The patient received vitamin K
and the Coumadin was held overnight.  The coagulation studies
are pending at the time of dictation, however the Coumadin
will be restarted with a goal INR of 2 to 3.

6.  NEUROLOGY:  The patient has a known history of multiple
cerebrovascular accidents with residual right hemiparesis,
Broca's aphasia and neurogenic bladder.  The patient remained
at his baseline.  Neurologic status without evidence of acute
neurologic events.

SUMMARY:  The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of
hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, atrial
fibrillation, congestive heart failure with a severely
depressed ejection fraction and history of multiple
cerebrovascular accident who is admitted with acute on
chronic renal insufficiency, hypotension and hyperkalemia in
the setting of recently increased ACE inhibitor, decreased
p.o. intake and urinary tract infection.

The patient is now status post a brief Medical Intensive Care
Unit stay with resolving acute renal failure, normotension,
and on empiric antibiotics for a urinary tract infection.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      69 year old man with hematuria due to prostatic bleeding                        
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      suprapubic catheter

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY: 69 year old male with severe left arm swelling due to DVT.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: The procedure was performed by Drs. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 526**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 85**] and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 615**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] with
     the attending radiologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 85**], being present for the entire procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: The risks and benefits were explained to the patient's
     wife and consent was obtained.
     
     The patient was placed supine on the angiographic table and the right groin
     and left arm were prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  Under local
     anesthesia, the right common femoral vein was accessed using a 19 gauge needle
     and a 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 528**] wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava.  The needle
     was exchanged for a long 6 french [**Last Name (un) 8335**]-tip sheath with the tip in the
     superior vena cava over the [**Location (un) 8903**] wire. A 5 french H1 catheter was placed
     over the wire and advanced into the left brachiocephalic vein, however, the
     wire could not be advanced into the left subclavian vein.  Injection of
     contrast through the H1 catheter showed occlusion of the left subclavian vein
     at its junction with the left internal jugular vein. A 0.035 super stiff
     glidewire was used to cannulate the left subclavian vein but only advanced
     into the collateral veins.
     
     The left arm was prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  Under local
     anesthesia and ultrasonographic guidance, the left antecubital vein was
     accessed using a 21 gauge needle and a 0.018 wire was advanced into the
     basilic vein.  The needle was exchanged for a micropuncture sheath.  Injection
     of contrast shows the left basilic vein and its communicating superficial
     veins are full of filling defects suggestive of thrombosis.  The left axillary
     vein was not opacified. Some contrast flows through the collateral veins and
                                                                 (Over)

     opacified the left subclavian vein which also fills with blood clots. A 0.035
     super stiff gluidewire was advanced through the sheath and the basilic vein
     with its tip into the left brachiocephalic vein.  A short 6 french sheath was
     placed over the wire into the basilic vein.  A 6 french Trellis Reserve
     infusion catheter was placed over the wire with its distal balloon in the
     medial left subclavian vein and its proximal balloon in the basilic vein. Both
     balloons were inflated and totally 6 mg of Alteplase were injected through the
     catheter into the occluded vein.  The system was on for approximately 15
     minutes and then the lysed blood clot was aspirated through the catheter.
     Fibrin-like material is seen in the aspirated blood.   Injection of contrast
     showed the significantly less filling defects in the vein, however there is
     tight stricture in the medial subclavian vein just before its junction with
     the internal jugular vein.  A 6 mm x 4 cm  balloon was advanced over the wire
     in the left arm and used to dilate the subclavian stricture.  Since a larger
     diameter of the balloon was needed, a through-through system was made.  A
     0.035 [**Doctor Last Name 555**] wire was advanced through the left arm vein with its tip in the
     subclavian vein.  A 15 mm snare was instilled through the right femoral vein
     sheath and advanced into the left subclavian vein.  The [**Doctor Last Name 555**] wire was
     advanced and caught by the snare and pulled out through the right femoral
     sheath i na foreign body removal maneuver.  A 10 mm x 4 cm balloon was
     advanced through the [**Doctor Last Name 555**] wire in the femoral sheath and used to dilate the
     left subclavian vein stricture. Followup venograms through Cobra catheter in
     the left arm showed significant improvement in the caliber of the left
     subclavian vein. The Trellis Reserve infusion catheter was placed again into
     the left subclavian, axilla and basilic veins and 6 mg of TPA were injected to
     lysis the residual blood clots. The final followup venogram through the sheath
     in the left arm showed smooth lumen in the left basilic, axilla and subclavian
     veins with no significant residual thrombosis. Contrast flow into the SVC  and
     on significant collateral veins were visualized.  At the end of the procedure
     both sheaths were removed and local hemostasis was achieved with manual
     compression.
     
     The patient tolerated the procedure well with no complications.
     
     Totally 200 cc of 60% Visipaque were used for the venograms.  Versed and
     fentanyl were given in small divided doses during the procedure for conscious
     sedation.
     
     IMPRESSION: Successful thrombectomy and thrombolysis of left arm DVT.

     super stiff gluidewire was advanced through the sheath and the basilic vein
     with its tip into the left brachiocephalic vein.  A short 6 french sheath was
     placed over the wire into the basilic vein.  A 6 french Trellis Reserve
     infusion catheter was placed over the wire with its distal balloon in the
     medial left subclavian vein and its proximal balloon in the basilic vein. Both
     balloons were inflated and totally 6 mg of Alteplase were injected through the
     catheter into the occluded vein.  The system was on for approximately 15
     minutes and then the lysed blood clot was aspirated through the catheter.
     Fibrin-like material is seen in the aspirated blood.   Injection of contrast
     showed the significantly less filling defects in the vein, however there is
     tight stricture in the medial subclavian vein just before its junction with
     the internal jugular vein.  A 6 mm x 4 cm  balloon was advanced over the wire
     in the left arm and used to dilate the subclavian stricture.  Since a larger
     diameter of the balloon was needed, a through-through system was made.  A
     0.035 [**Doctor Last Name 555**] wire was advanced through the left arm vein with its tip in the

     advanced and caught by the snare and pulled out through the right femoral
     sheath i na foreign body removal maneuver.  A 10 mm x 4 cm balloon was
     advanced through the [**Doctor Last Name 555**] wire in the femoral sheath and used to dilate the
     left subclavian vein stricture. Followup venograms through Cobra catheter in
     the left arm showed significant improvement in the caliber of the left
     subclavian vein. The Trellis Reserve infusion catheter was placed again into
     the left subclavian, axilla and basilic veins and 6 mg of TPA were injected to
     lysis the residual blood clots. The final followup venogram through the sheath
     in the left arm showed smooth lumen in the left basilic, axilla and subclavian
     veins with no significant residual thrombosis. Contrast flow into the SVC  and
     on significant collateral veins were visualized.  At the end of the procedure
     both sheaths were removed and local hemostasis was achieved with manual
     compression.
     
     The patient tolerated the procedure well with no complications.
     
     Totally 200 cc of 60% Visipaque were used for the venograms.  Versed and

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      69 year old man with hematuria due to prostatic bleeding                        
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      suprapubic catheter                                                             
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY: 69 year old male with severe left arm swelling due to DVT.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: The procedure was performed by Drs. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 526**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 85**] and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 615**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] with
     the attending radiologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 85**], being present for the entire procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: The risks and benefits were explained to the patient's
     wife and consent was obtained.
     
     The patient was placed supine on the angiographic table and the right groin
     and left arm were prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  Under local
     anesthesia, the right common femoral vein was accessed using a 19 gauge needle
     and a 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 528**] wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava.  The needle
     was exchanged for a long 6 french [**Last Name (un) 8335**]-tip sheath with the tip in the
     superior vena cava over the [**Location (un) 8903**] wire. A 5 french H1 catheter was placed
     over the wire and advanced into the left brachiocephalic vein, however, the
     wire could not be advanced into the left subclavian vein.  Injection of
     contrast through the H1 catheter showed occlusion of the left subclavian vein
     at its junction with the left internal jugular vein. A 0.035 super stiff
     glidewire was used to cannulate the left subclavian vein but only advanced
     into the collateral veins.
     
     The left arm was prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  Under local
     anesthesia and ultrasonographic guidance, the left antecubital vein was
     accessed using a 21 gauge needle and a 0.018 wire was advanced into the
     basilic vein.  The needle was exchanged for a micropuncture sheath.  Injection
     of contrast shows the left basilic vein and its communicating superficial
     veins are full of filling defects suggestive of thrombosis.  The left axillary
     vein was not opacified. Some contrast flows through the collateral veins and
                                                                 (Over)

     opacified the left subclavian vein which also fills with blood clots. A 0.035
     super stiff gluidewire was advanced through the sheath and the basilic vein
     with its tip into the left brachiocephalic vein.  A short 6 french sheath was
     placed over the wire into the basilic vein.  A 6 french Trellis Reserve
     infusion catheter was placed over the wire with its distal balloon in the
     medial left subclavian vein and its proximal balloon in the basilic vein. Both
     balloons were inflated and totally 6 mg of Alteplase were injected through the
     catheter into the occluded vein.  The system was on for approximately 15
     minutes and then the lysed blood clot was aspirated through the catheter.
     Fibrin-like material is seen in the aspirated blood.   Injection of contrast
     showed the significantly less filling defects in the vein, however there is
     tight stricture in the medial subclavian vein just before its junction with
     the internal jugular vein.  A 6 mm x 4 cm  balloon was advanced over the wire
     in the left arm and used to dilate the subclavian stricture.  Since a larger
     diameter of the balloon was needed, a through-through system was made.  A
     0.035 [**Doctor Last Name 555**] wire was advanced through the left arm vein with its tip in the
     subclavian vein.  A 15 mm snare was instilled through the right femoral vein
     sheath and advanced into the left subclavian vein.  The [**Doctor Last Name 555**] wire was
     advanced and caught by the snare and pulled out through the right femoral
     sheath i na foreign body removal maneuver.  A 10 mm x 4 cm balloon was
     advanced through the [**Doctor Last Name 555**] wire in the femoral sheath and used to dilate the
     left subclavian vein stricture. Followup venograms through Cobra catheter in
     the left arm showed significant improvement in the caliber of the left
     subclavian vein. The Trellis Reserve infusion catheter was placed again into
     the left subclavian, axilla and basilic veins and 6 mg of TPA were injected to
     lysis the residual blood clots. The final followup venogram through the sheath
     in the left arm showed smooth lumen in the left basilic, axilla and subclavian
     veins with no significant residual thrombosis. Contrast flow into the SVC  and
     on significant collateral veins were visualized.  At the end of the procedure
     both sheaths were removed and local hemostasis was achieved with manual
     compression.
     
     The patient tolerated the procedure well with no complications.
     
     Totally 200 cc of 60% Visipaque were used for the venograms.  Versed and
     fentanyl were given in small divided doses during the procedure for conscious
     sedation.
     
     IMPRESSION: Successful thrombectomy and thrombolysis of left arm DVT.
     
     
                                                                 (Over)

     sheath and advanced into the left subclavian vein.  The [**Doctor Last Name 555**] wire was
     advanced and caught by the snare and pulled out through the right femoral
     sheath i na foreign body removal maneuver.  A 10 mm x 4 cm balloon was
     advanced through the [**Doctor Last Name 555**] wire in the femoral sheath and used to dilate the
     left subclavian vein stricture. Followup venograms through Cobra catheter in
     the left arm showed significant improvement in the caliber of the left
     subclavian vein. The Trellis Reserve infusion catheter was placed again into
     the left subclavian, axilla and basilic veins and 6 mg of TPA were injected to
     lysis the residual blood clots. The final followup venogram through the sheath
     in the left arm showed smooth lumen in the left basilic, axilla and subclavian
     veins with no significant residual thrombosis. Contrast flow into the SVC  and
     on significant collateral veins were visualized.  At the end of the procedure
     both sheaths were removed and local hemostasis was achieved with manual
     compression.
     
     The patient tolerated the procedure well with no complications.
     
     Totally 200 cc of 60% Visipaque were used for the venograms.  Versed and
     fentanyl were given in small divided doses during the procedure for conscious
     sedation.
     
     IMPRESSION: Successful thrombectomy and thrombolysis of left arm DVT.
